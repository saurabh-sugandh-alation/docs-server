Definitions
-------------

**Metadata Extraction (MDE)**—Extraction of metadata from a source into the Alation catalog to provide users with a representation of the data in this source. Metadata extraction can be run manually or on an automatic schedule that depends on your organization's needs and usage.

**Sampling**—Retrieval of data samples from cataloged data sources. When users perform sampling, Alation scans the first 10,000 rows of a table. A data sample is a random sample of 100 rows out of those 10,000 scanned rows. Data samples are intended to provide an insight into data in the tables in the catalog.

**Profiling**—Retrieval of a data sample for a column and statistical calculations on this sample. The profiling results are represented on the **Frequency Distribution** chart for a column object.

**Query Log Ingestion (QLI)**—Processing of a selection of database query logs in order to calculate Popularity, Top Users, and supply JOIN information to the catalog.

**Popularity**—Indicator of the popularity (intensity of use) of a data object, such as a table or a column. Popularity is calculated through an algorithm that analyzes both the results of Query Log Ingestion and Compose usage to determine the number of Alation users that have used the object and the number of times the object has been used.

**Compose**—Alation query tool for authoring, running, and publishing SQL queries to the data catalog.

**Lineage**—Visual representation of how tables, views, and BI reports are derived from source tables.

**Column-Level Lineage**—Visual representation of data lineage on the level of a column object.
