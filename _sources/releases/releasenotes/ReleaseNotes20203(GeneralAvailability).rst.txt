Release Notes 2020.3 (General Availability)
==============================================

RELEASE 2020.3.9
------------------------

*build 5.17.10.138502*

- Fixed a problem when sometimes a subset of web server workers on the Alation server hung and did not serve requests. This fix improves throughput and availability of the Alation web service.

RELEASE 2020.3.8
------------------------

*build 5.17.9.130830*

- Previously, metadata extraction from Snowflake extracted the view names in upper case when the original view name was in mixed case. After this fix, metadata extraction of views extracts the view names in mixed case.

- Fixed a performance issue with search indexing for file objects. This change is expected to make file system objects indexing 3 to 5 times faster.

- Added support for user impersonation for EMR Presto as Custom DB: users can use impersonation for running queries in Compose.


RELEASE 2020.3.7
------------------------

*build 5.17.8.127669*

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For Custom DB, Alation now allows Data Source Admins to enable concurrent queries for Compose. This can be done on the **Custom Settings** tab of the Custom DB data source Settings page with the help of the **Enable Concurrent Queries** checkbox.

- For Custom DB, Alation now allows Data Source Admins to enable **User Impersonation**. This can be used when configuring Kerberos and Keytab authentication for Compose for the data sources that support this setup. User Impersonation can be turned **On** on the **General Settings** tab of the Custom DB data source Settings page.

Bug Fix
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed the issue of Lexicon overflow error by capping the approve/reject count to 7,000. In the Lexicon job, if the approve/reject count exceeds 7,000, the exceeded count will be capped at 7,000.

RELEASE 2020.3.6
------------------------

*build 5.17.7.125879*

- For Amazon S3 users, fixed an issue where Alation would not extract the last batch of files when extracting more than 1,000 files. For example, if a filesystem had 1,234 files, 1,000 would be extracted and 234 would be ignored.

- For BI users, fixed an issue where setting the automated extraction job from the UI would not make any changes.

- For Hive users, fixed an issue where query logs generated by Hive 2.x would not be extracted when they were URL encoded. Users facing this issue need to include a configuration file named **aha-conf.xml** in their configuration tarball for the datasource. That configuration file should contain the following lines:

    .. code-block:: console

        <configuration>
          <property>
            <name>alation.qli.check-url-decode</name>
            <value>true</value>
          </property>
        </configuration>

RELEASE 2020.3.5
------------------------

*build 5.17.6.124318*

- Fixed an issue with data migration during upgrade to 2020.3 or higher where the upgrade failed if no authenticated user existed in the system with a primary key of 1. This has been changed to assign ownership of the saved connections to the data source creator.

- Previously, extraction from Tableau 2020.1 skipped some workbooks when permission mirroring was enabled. This issue has now been fixed.

- Previously, even if the **Signup Moderation** feature was enabled, all new users logging into Alation using LDAP would have their user accounts active before the Admins could approve them. After this fix, if Signup Moderation is enabled, admin users can approve/reject user accounts of LDAP users before those users can log in to Alation.

- For Google BigQuery sources, fixed an issue with MDE and Profiling not working after changes to the service account setup. When a user account certificate was uploaded in addition to the service account and then deleted, MDE and Profiling became unavailable. This has now been fixed.

- Fixed an issue where lineage calculation failed in some scenarios involving connections between "temp" columns to actual columns in the graph.

RELEASE 2020.3.3
------------------------

*build 5.17.4.121765*

- Fixed an issue with rich text formatting where text formatted as bold in the Edit mode did not appear as bold after the field was saved. Now, emphasizing with bold works as expected.

- Previously, when one database was cataloged in Alation as multiple Data Sources, each of these sources containing a different schema from the database, and one BI object was sourced from database objects in different Data Sources, only one lineage diagram was displayed correctly, while others would display source data objects as TMP objects. This issue has now been fixed.

- Fixed an issue of the Export feature not working for data samples when exported values contained a mix of HTML-escaped and unescaped characters.

- Previously, triggering a search on the Compose page would sometimes result in a 500 error message on the page but no network error, particularly when the search result has been highlighted. This search results error has now been fixed.

- Previously, certain BI and File System objects were incorrectly shown as "Untitled [Object Type]" in Full Search results. This fix resolves the issue. Relevant object titles will now appear for BI and File System objects in search results.

RELEASE 2020.3.2
------------------------

*build 5.17.3.120743*

- Added the "Inactive" state for Trust Flags in the Alation UI. If a user does not have permission to edit the Trust Flags for an object, then to this user, they will appear as disabled on the Catalog page of the object.

- Fixed an issue when Oracle synonyms were extracted even if the synonym extraction was disabled. Oracle synonym extraction can be enabled or disabled on the Admin Settings > **Labs** page.

- Fixed an issue with LDAP authentication when users with usernames containing Cyrillic characters could not log in to Alation.

- Improved initial page loading performance by deferring the loading of conversations in the left-hand navigation panel.

- Optimized the data sources API to reduce the loading time of the **Sources** page.

- Added subject indexes to Flags to improve Flag lookup performance for a given catalog object. This is intended to decrease page loading time when Flag propagation is enabled.

- Alation Connector Manager of the Open Connector Framework is no longer dependent upon a particular behavior of "pidof" in order to query the run status of the Docker daemon.

RELEASE 2020.3.1
------------------------

*build 5.17.2.118938*

- Fixed the issue of email notifications not being sent to all users @-mentioned in a Conversation if multiple users were @-mentioned in one post.

- Alation now supports Azure Blob Storage extraction for AzureCN access endpoint in the file system.

- Fixes several issues reported in 2020.3 LA (5.17.0) **related to the Snowflake OAuth** functionality and the related default Compose connection URI editing feature:

      - For non-Snowflake data sources or Snowflake data sources without OAuth enabled, data upload would use the service account URI to connect rather than the default Compose connection URI. Also, for OAuth-enabled Snowflake data sources, data upload would not run with the selected and/or authorized Snowflake user if there was already a connection open on the server for the specified URI that had not yet been closed due to being idle. These issues with data upload have been fixed.

      - For non-Snowflake data sources or Snowflake data sources without OAuth enabled, a query form would use the service account URI to connect rather than the default Compose connection URI. Also, for OAuth-enabled Snowflake data sources, query forms would not run with the selected and/or authorized Snowflake user if there was already a connection open on the server for the specified URI and for that particular query that had not yet been closed due to being idle. These issues with query forms have been fixed.

      - For non-Snowflake data sources or Snowflake data sources without OAuth enabled, dynamic profiling would use the service account URI to connect rather than the default Compose connection URI. This issue has been fixed.

      - The OAuth client secret was serialized and sent back to the Alation UI. This has been corrected by changing the serializer to treat the client secret field as write-only. After the fix, the client id and secret are not updated on each call.

      - Issues with authorization redirect in Desktop Compose have been fixed; it would erroneously display "Authorization terminated unexpectedly" when authorization was successful; similarly, when the browser URL differs from the base URL or hostname of the Alation server (if the browser is using the Alation server's IP address), the same error message would be displayed. When the browser URL doesn't specify the correct Alation base URL hostname, "Authorization terminated unexpectedly" will be displayed only if there is an authorization error; with Desktop Compose, it will try to make a connection regardless of whether authorization had succeeded and report whether there are any subsequent connection issues due to expired or missing authorization tokens.

      - When OAuth is enabled for a Datasource and the "Test Authorization" button is clicked, the username associated with the authorization is not displayed in the "Authorized as:" section. Have made changes to ensure that the username is updated and displayed appropriately.

- Added auto-trimming extra spaces in Compose for the fixed length ``char`` type and the ``nchar`` type.

- Fetching of published queries for Schema and Table catalog pages is now done on demand to prevent slowness of the catalog page loading and to reduce the loading time for these pages.

- Added ``alation.feature_flags.enabled_flash_plugin`` flag to the **alation_conf** utility. Setting it to ``False`` hides the Adobe Flash-dependent **Copy** and **Download** buttons from QLI Preview actions.

- Previously, Snowflake CREATE VIEW queries with COPY GRANTS keywords did not show up in the **View SQL** area and the Lineage diagram. Now, such queries will be displayed correctly.

RELEASE 2020.3 - General Availability
--------------------------------------------------

*build 5.17.1.118021*

Full-Page Unified Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introducing the **New Search** experience with

- a prominent search box on the front center or top center of the page;
- the full-page search results list;
- comprehensive multi-dimensional filters;
- detailed, descriptive result previews.

The New Search unifies two separate search features - the Quick Search (or Left-Hand Navigation) and Advanced Search - into one tool for every search need. It includes the query auto-complete feature; relevancy ranking; ability to browse all objects, objects by category or search within a specific object type; and ability to download the search results list. Trust flags are now displayed in search results next to the object title to direct users to trusted data. Note that the previous search tools are still available to allow for a smooth transition from the old to the new experience.

See :doc:`Search </welcome/CatalogBasics/FullPageSearch>`  for an overview of the New Search.

New Catalog UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release reveals the updated Catalog UI, with changes to color scheme, UI element design, typography, and iconography. Most of the UI changes appear purely visual and aesthetic, but there are also a number of subtle changes to the layout on pages of Catalog objects. Team Alation worked to make this change unobtrusive so that your knowledge of the Catalog actions and workflows remains intact. The work on the new UI will continue in the future releases.

New Homepage UI and Configuration page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2020.3, the customizable Homepage (first available in V R4 (5.9.x)) has been restyled with:

- an improved layout,
- new custom branding options,
- a dedicated configuration page in the Admin Settings.

The New Homepage is enabled by default when your instance is upgraded to 2020.3. If you have never enabled a customizable homepage, then your instance will inherit the default Homepage version. If you have previously enabled the customizable Homepage, your customizations will transition seamlessly into the new style.

Starting with 2020.3, Server Admins can customize the Homepage from a dedicated configuration tab **Customize Homepage** in the Admin Settings.

Improved Global Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main toolbar now features an **Apps** menu and a Search bar instead of multiple links to sections of the Catalog. The new **Apps** menu provides access to the various Catalog applications, such as Governance Tracking Dashboard, Glossaries, or Compose. The central component of the top navigation panel is now the Search bar for users to find the data they need from anywhere in the Catalog, anytime.

Snowflake SSO for Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation now supports SSO using OAuth in Compose for Snowflake data sources. Both Snowflake Built-in OAuth and External OAuth with Okta are supported. Data Source Admins can enable and configure OAuth connection for Compose on the Snowflake data source Settings > **General Settings** page. When a Snowflake data source is OAuth-enabled, Compose users will connect to it by authenticating on the OAuth authorization server instead of connecting directly with their Snowflake user account. When scheduling a query, users have an option to select an OAuth connection to be used for the scheduled query run. To run a query, to schedule it, or to run a query form, users may need to re-authorize with the source if their access token has expired.

Custom DB Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added the ability:

- to set the **Limit Query Template** for Profiling that limits the number of rows selected for Profiling to 10,000: :ref:`Custom Settings > Limit Query Template <Sampling_Profiling-Limit-Query-Template>`

- to select the **Catalog Object Definition** to correctly represent the extracted metadata in the Catalog: :ref:`Set the Catalog Object Definition <Metadata_Extraction_From_Custom_DB-Set-The-Catalog-Object-Definition>`

- to define a custom subset of data to be sampled with custom Profiling queries for Table objects that can be set up in :ref:`Per-Object Parameters <Sampling_Profiling-Per_Object_Parameters>`

MicroStrategy on GBM V2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to add MicroStrategy sources to Alation using the GBM V2 framework.

:ref:`Generic BI Model V2 for MicroStrategy Sources <MicroStrategy-Generic_BI_Model_V2>`

Backup and Restore V2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introducing an improved backup and restore functionality that is designed to reduce the time of the backup process, increases the backup and restore reliability, and adds backup integrity validation, as well as backup logging and monitoring capabilities. With Backup and Restore V2, you can choose to create incremental backups saving disk space and considerably decreasing the backup time. This feature must be enabled with a dedicated `alation_action` command and requires a number of configuration flags to be set before usage.

:doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/index`

Alation Analytics V2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation Analytics Version 2 (V2) is the new version of Alation Analytics that gives you the data you need to accelerate and simplify adoption of the Catalog.  Alation Analytics V2 addresses the known performance and data accessibility issues of the existing Alation Analytics database (Version 1). It features a completely redesigned data model with the focus on the scope and accessibility of the data available for analysis. Ready-to-use visualizations of popular catalog adoption metrics have been added to the catalog as part of V2. The database ERD and data dictionary are installed as part of the package. V2 also meets the need for scalability as it makes it possible to remotely deploy the Alation Analytics server, with its components installed using Docker containers.

 :doc:`Alation Analytics V2 <../../installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/index>`

API Access Token Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Generate Tokens for the Alation API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/authentication-into-alation-apis>`_

Access Token Management API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding new public APIs for managing API access token generation and authentication to use the Alation APIs. The main difference from the previous releases is that the generated tokens now have an expiration value. This API introduces two types of Tokens:

- **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token that can be used to manage and create API AccessTokens.

- **API Access Token**: A short-lived access token to be used to interact with the Alation APIs. This token must be passed as the value for the 'TOKEN' header in API requests to the Alation server.

The lifetime of tokens is configurable using the **alation_conf**. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/api_authentication/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

The Get Token API from previous releases remains fully functional but can be disabled using the **alation_conf**.

Access Token Management UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can generate Refresh and Access tokens in the Alation UI on the User Account Settings > **Authentication** page.

Lineage V2 API Enhancement: Dataflow Objects API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introducing a new API for managing Dataflow Objects for Lineage V2: POST, DELETE, PATCH, and GET requests for Dataflow objects have now been added for users to be able to build detailed lineage in Alation. You can bulk-create, update, and read the metadata for Dataflow objects, including names, descriptions, and paths. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format in Swagger UI at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/lineage/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

Custom Field API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added the Custom Field API (read-only) that lets you get all custom fields available on the Admin Settings > Catalog Admin > **Customize Catalog** page. The Custom Field API is accessible to users with the Server Admin role only. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format in Swagger UI at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/custom_field/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

Custom Field Value API V2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added the Custom Field Value API V2 that lets you get and update Custom Field values for the DataFlow objects and the BI objects (GBM V2 only). The API requires the Server Admin role. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format in Swagger UI at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/custom_field_value/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

User API
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added a new User API (read-only) that allows a Server Admin user to get basic User metadata from the Alation instance. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format in Swagger UI at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/user/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

Group API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added the new Group API (read-only) that allows a Server Admin user to get basic Group metadata from the Alation instance. The specification for this API is available in the OAS 3.0 format in Swagger UI at `{AlationInstanceURL}/openapi/group/` (requires the Swagger UI flag `alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger` to be set to `True` in **alation_conf**).

API Throttling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API throttling is an optional feature for the public APIs that gives admin users the ability to set rate limits for their users. Note that the feature is available to all APIs using the Public API functionality but is only enabled for the users if they are registered in the
`api_throttles.yaml` configuration file. Execute the following command in the Alation shell to see the list of available configurations: `alation_conf throttling`.

Scarlet
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scarlet is complementary software developed by Alation as a system to test upgrades to patch releases or new major releases before updates are applied to the production environment. Its other goal is to reduce the feedback cycle for new features and bug fixes by automating the collection of all troubleshooting information. Scarlet automatically creates a copy of the Alation production instance and upgrades it to a newer Alation version allowing the admin user to uncover any update or post-update issues that would potentially affect Production. In 2020.3 Alation releases Scarlet on a case-by-case basis. Please contact your account manager if you would like to learn more about the Scarlet program or would like to try out Scarlet.

Sources
~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the built-in driver for **Snowflake** data sources to version 3.12.2.

- Updated the built-in driver for **Google BigQuery** data sources to version 1.2.3.1006.

- **Google BigQuery** data sources now support the Profiling for Record and Struct data types. These data types are represented in the Catalog using the DocStore format.

- For **Custom DB** sources, the Profiling job now successfully extracts the array data type.

- Alation now has the ability to ingest query logs from ADLS Gen 1, Gen 2, and Azure BLOB storage for the Azure Databricks data sources.

- **GBM V2 enabled by default**: The GBM V2 feature flag is now TRUE by default. The Tableau Legacy framework is no longer available. Tableau sources can only be added using the GBM V2 BI model.

The Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Search index**: Improved performance of search re-indexing for the Column type of objects.

- **Hats removed**: the Hats selection feature was removed. Users will no longer have to select a Hat when they log in. Access to functionality in Alation is controlled by Alation roles assigned to users in the Admin interface.

- **Default Alation role**: Added the ability to configure the default Alation role. Server Admins can now set a default role on the Admin Settings > **Authentication** tab. The default role will be assigned to all new users who join Alation. The default role setting works in all authentication modes: built-in, SAML, or LDAP.

- **Branding**: The Branding tab in the Admin Settings > **Server Admin** section is now enabled by default.

Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed an issue where bulk-upload of usernames could not complete if the CSV file contained usernames with more than 30 characters. Now, admins can successfully bulk-upload users from CSV. Note that usernames longer than 30 characters are still truncated to 30 characters in the Alation user account.

- Previously, users whose account was inactive (suspended or pending activation) became caught in a redirection loop between their IdP and the Alation Server when they tried to log in to Alation. Now, users with inactive accounts will be redirected to the **Inactive Users** page.

- In V R7 (5.12.x), the temporary files created during SAML authentication were not cleared from the Alation server and accumulated over time. Now, the SAML authentication temp files are auto-deleted as soon as authentication is done.

- Fixed a number of priority issues with the New UI.

- Fixed an issue where the Top Banner would show the **Powered by** text as a result of specific customization settings.

- Improved the scrolling experience on Homepage 2020.3.

- Fixed a number of Compose styling issues that were reported for the 3 Compose UI modes. For the Dusk mode, the following is fixed:

      - Current database account name was too dark for the background;
      - The Schedule Details title in the scheduling tooltip was too dark and unreadable;

      A few more similar UI bugs were fixed for all 3 modes.

- Previously, the license expiration time on the Admin Settings > **License** page was inaccurate in some scenarios. This issue was fixed, and now the license expiration date information in Alation always matches the date in the license file.

- Previously, Unicode characters in user display names caused an internal error in search indexing; conversations would not be indexed and attempts to navigate to them would result in errors. This has now been addressed.

- Fixed a bug where no synonyms were extracted if the user had permissions on some but not all tables with synonyms. Now, the synonyms are extracted if users have permissions on the base table.

- Fixed an issue where the use of the usage reporting feature (Admin Settings > Reporting) resulted in an incomplete usage data package and an error. After the fix, an admin can successfully upload usage metrics from the Alation instance.

- Previously, on the last day before the license expiration, all Alation users would have been locked out of the UI. After this fix, users can continue to work in their Alation Catalog during the last day before license expiration. It is recommended to renew the Alation license in timely fashion.

- Fixed an issue where the first attempt to upload a custom logo to the Customizable Homepage did not succeed.

- Fixed a bug where an attempt to use the User and Group APIs with the feature flag `enable_permissions_middleware_feature` set to `True` results in the 500 error.

- Previously, server admins could not revoke all API Access tokens for a user in bulk. This is now fixed.

- Fixed an issue with the `alation_chmod_permissions` script which did not work after Django upgrade in V R7 and 2020.3 LA.

- Fixed an issue with deleting Dataflow objects: when an Dataflow object was deleted but a user tried to access it by directly typing the URL, Alation UI would show a loading icon indefinitely instead of the 404 error page.

- Fixed an issue where the Lexicon job run fails if the column name has more than 200 characters.

- Miscellaneous other bug fixes.


RELEASE 2020.3 - Limited Availability
-----------------------------------------------

*build 5.17.0.116556*

For new features in 2020.3, see the GA release notes.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Previously, when SAML authentication was used with the option to moderate user sign-up requests, a server admin was unable to reject any sign-up requests that appeared in Alation. After this fix, the admins can reject sign-up requests as expected.

- Fixed a bug where the server URL for Tableau data sources was extracted incorrectly.

- For Alation Analytics, changed the condition in `ObjectFieldLogicalETLJob` to prevent the processing of records when `value_otype` or `value_oid` is null, which previously caused this ETL job to fail with errors and caused performance issues.

- Previously, metadata extraction from Amazon Redshift failed with an NPE due to NULL value types in the distribution node extraction query result. To fix the issue, distribution node metadata extraction was disabled for Redshift as it is not required to be displayed on the Catalog pages.

- MicroStrategy sources no longer require to add the HTTP or HTTPS protocol prefix to the URL when setting up the connection.

- Previously, the start time for active tasks was displayed in the UTC time zone in Admin Settings > **Monitor** > **Active Tasks**. Now, the start time is shown in the local time zone that the user logs in to Alation from.

- Previously, in Compose, when users tried to run the first query for a new data source, clicking **Run** or **Run Full Query** would result in no response until the page was refreshed. This also caused the auto-suggest to not work for this first query. This issue has been fixed, and the Run functionality and auto-suggest will work for all queries as expected.

- Fixed an issue where scheduled extraction from Tableau would run a day after it was scheduled. Now, scheduled extraction will be performed as expected.

- The jobs API response has been updated to correctly reflect the status of a running job for programmatic handling.

- Fixed an issue with metadata extraction from MongoDB data sources where it failed if DBRef objects were present. After the fix, MDE will complete successfully.

- Extraction from a MicroStrategy source could cause exceptions on the MicroStrategy server when the auto-generated Row Count field (metric type = "Unknown") was included into the extracted project. This fix adds validation for metrics of such type, which will correctly extract their metadata into Alation.

- Fixed an issue where the query title disappeared from the Queries tab of a data source. After the fix, query titles and descriptions are displayed as expected in the list of queries.

- Fixed an issue where MDE failed with a `UnicodeDecodeException` error when a Function/SP was ingested from the yaml files that contained specific characters. After the fix, MDE will interpret the symbols correctly and proceed.

- Fixed the ability to create `BIReport` and `BIReportColumn` objects with the field `description_at_source` using the GBM V2 API.

- Fixed a bug where users received a 404 error when they clicked on the link for an object with the camel-cased name on the search results page.

- Fixed a UI bug where Custom Field titles were truncated on catalog pages of some objects. Now, the full titles will be displayed as expected.

- Fixed a bug where the Server, Workbook, and Reports links from a MicroStrategy source redirected to an incorrect URL. The fix applies to sources on the GBM V2 framework.

- Previously, when the Viewer role was enabled, the users with the Catalog Admin, Source Admin, Composer, or Steward roles could not discard an auto suggested title. Now, all the users except Viewers can discard auto-suggested titles.

- Fixed a bug on the Customizable Homepage when users with the Viewer role could see the Write Articles and Write SQL cards although the Viewer role was enforced. After the fix, these cards are only visible to users with enough permissions to create articles and queries.

- Fixed a bug where the **Go to Access** dialog would throw a Permission denied error when a server admin tried to access the settings of the Alation Analytics data source. After the fix, Go to Access button opens the Access tab of the Settings page.

- Fixed a bug which allowed logged-in users to make API requests without first having verified their email.

- API response for the NoSQL job API was changed to the JSON format.

- Fixed a bug where scale and precision were not displayed for the data types in the Vertica data sources.

Known Issues in LA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New Customizable Homepage: the first attempt to upload a custom logo does not succeed. Admin Settings > **Customize Homepage**: when a valid logo file is uploaded, the Alation UI does not display the uploaded file. To troubleshoot, refresh the browser page and re-upload the logo a second time. The second attempt should be successful. **FIXED IN GA**

- An attempt to use the User and Group APIs with the feature flag `enable_permissions_middleware_feature` set to `True` results in the 500 error. **FIXED IN GA**

- Currently Server Admins cannot revoke all API Access tokens for a user at once. **FIXED IN GA**

- `alation_chmod_permissions` script does not work after Django upgrade (in R7 and above). **FIXED IN GA**

- For Databricks on Azure as Custom DB, an attempt to export the Profiling results for a table may end in an error when values contain complex data types (struct, record, and array), and/or mixed Unicode and ASCII characters.

- When an Dataflow object is deleted, but a user tries to access it by directly typing the URL, Alation UI shows a loading icon indefinitely instead of the 404 error page. **FIXED IN GA**

- For Google BigQuery sources, if selective extraction is followed by full extraction, the catalog pages of complex data types display an `Unexpected error` message.

- MDE from Azure ADLS Gen 2 may fail if it takes longer than the access token lifetime. This issue only applies to large systems where MDE takes a long time due to the size of the metadata to be extracted.

- For Oracle 11g using the SSL with Kerberos connection setup, the Service Account validation fails when the built-in driver `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver.ojdbc7.12.1.0.2-tlsPatch` is used. As a workaround, use the built-in driver `oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver.ojdbc7.12.1.0.2`.

- For Greenplum 6, the CREATE queries run from Compose are stored as empty values in the query_text field in the queries_history table.

- After a deprecated Dataflow object is deleted from the catalog, the propagated deprecation remains on the downstream objects and cannot be removed.

- When the Alation server is configured to use LDAP authentication, and at the same time the User Signup Moderation Preference is enabled, all new user accounts created are active by default and do go through the Admin moderation as expected.
