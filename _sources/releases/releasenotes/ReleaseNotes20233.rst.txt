- On the Top Contributors Dashboard, if a user no longer exists in Alation but does exist in the Alation Analytics data source, then an asterisk will be appended to the user's name in the Top Contributors Dashboard. (AL-138679)

Enable Third-Party Metrics in Alation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Naming and default values for feature flags that enable outgoing requests to Pendo and other third-party analytics tools have been made more consistent. This is enabled by default. Each third-party analytics tool has a dedicated feature flag that customer admins can enable or disable from the feature flags admin page. (AL-140552)

Alation Analytics Backup and Restore Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Improved overall performance of Alation Analytics backup and restore. (AL-133755)

Compose Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ensured that the Compose Desktop menu item **Visit Help Center** Cloud Authorization redirects to the help center page as intended. (AL-137205)

Cloud Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCIM Token Generation Warning 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users will now receive a warning before generating a new SCIM token when a previous token already exists (expired or not). The warning will indicate that the previous token will be invalidated. (AL-138329)

Data Dictionary Improvements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upload Data Dictionary improvements include: (AL-138675) 
- You can now link Terms and Policies to data objects using Upload Dictionary. Terms and Policies links will also be downloaded in the object set field as part of the data dictionary file. 

- Period characters are now supported. The downloaded dictionary will have key_name quoted as required by the upload feature when names contain a period character.

- Non-admin users can now access upload dictionary without a page refresh.

- Enhanced object reference presentation in the data dictionary preview table. Previously, the title appeared as the text of the link within the object reference column. Now, when the key is available, it displays as link text; however, if the key is unavailable, the object's title will be shown as text in the link.

- Data Dictionary preview is now able to render fields with a comma in names.

Glossary and Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users will now see the **Stewards** field on all Glossary details pages. (AL-133299)

Governance Improvements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Policy ingested timestamp for policies that were ingested using the Native Snowflake Connector will be back-filled with the created timestamp. (AL-138443)

Group-based Homepages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Catalog admins can assign a homepage to one or more user groups. (AL-134390)

- Users that are part of the assigned group(s) that have a homepage will be able to view this homepage when they log in to the application. 

- Users that are already using role-based homepage associations will automatically be migrated to the group-based scheme. 

- If a user is part of multiple groups that have different homepages assigned, the user will be able to choose a preferred homepage. 

- When a user is not part of any group that has a homepage assigned or they haven't chosen a preferred homepage, they will be shown the Alation default homepage. 

Search Enhancements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Automated the task to analyze and update search index data. The task is configurable using alation_conf (to enable, disable, and schedule the task). (AL-129324)

APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCF Data Sources API Compose Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enhanced the API to be able to set up compose for data sources using OCF connectors. (AL-130098)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud Authorization: Bypass User Email Confirmation for SSO-based Authentication Flows 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A recent update from Python 3.6 to 3.9 caused empty passwords to be handled differently; as a result, users or requests provisioned in the system without a password and not a confirmed email address were redirected to the verify email page even if the password is not required for those users (like in the case of SCIM). Now the system will set non-empty passwords for all the users during the user creation flows to ensure that users won't get redirected to verify their email if they are not password users. (AL-139068).

Glossary and Articles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Removed an errant "b" that was prepended to the title slug in Article URLs. (AL-138356)

KVstore Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some users are affected by a memory hike on the KVstore and need to regularly reboot KVstore. The KVstore has been upgraded to 8.3.2 and will now consume less memory. (AL-142108)


PATCH RELEASE 2023.3.3.2
--------------------------

*build 17.3.2.58486*

*Released December 13, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for customer-managed (on-premise) Alation instances.

- Fixed an issue that prevented users from connecting to their OCF Impala data sources in Compose after transitioning from the Hive driver to the Cloudera Impala driver within the CDP connector. The corresponding driver in Compose was updated accordingly. Users can now connect and run queries as previously experienced. (AL-138914)


PATCH RELEASE 2023.3.3.1
--------------------------

*build 17.3.1.58212*

*Released December 5, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for Alation Cloud Service instances on the cloud-native architecture.

- Fixed a bug where a new Python-based wrapper script that was implemented to support additional Datadog features caused a bug which resulted in no logs in Datadog from any of the affected clusters. Now, the log availability in Datadog has been restored. (AL-140466)


RELEASE 2023.3.3
-------------------

*build 17.3.0.57463*

*Released December 4, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for all Alation instance types: customer-managed (on-premise) and Alation Cloud Service.

Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Past Scheduled Executions Dashboard for Admins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new dashboard is now available as a second tab next to the existing scheduled query admin dashboard that provides a tabular view of past scheduled executions. This feature aims at helping Server Admins understand the patterns of scheduled queries on their instance. They will be able to monitor if any schedules fail, take significant execution time, or were canceled. (AL-128832)

Improved Query Export Scalability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, the Run and Export actions sometimes failed for smaller exports and consistently failed for exports of over 1M records. The Run and Export functionality should now be stable for both small and large exports. (AL-125680)

Data Dictionary Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduced the feature flag ``alation.feature_flags.disable_perm_check_on_download_dd`` to disable permission checks when downloading data dictionaries. Permission checks may take a significant amount of time, which in some cases can delay the delivery of the download URL to users by a few hours. This flag allows disabling the permission checks from the backend. By default, the flag is set to ``False``, which means the **Download Dictionary** feature will check the permissions and the download option will be available for users with steward role and above. Setting this flag to ``True`` will disable the permission checks and the **Download Dictionary** option will only be visible to administrators. (AL-138107)
- Data Dictionary download now includes a new column, **al_datadict_column_data_type**, which contains the data type for each column. This information was previously contained in the **al_datadict_item_properties** column, but has now been broken out on its own. This column should be considered read-only.


- Added support for custom field names in upper or mixed case in the data dictionary file. (AL-137003)

- Added support for custom field names with a comma in headers. (AL-138310)

- A summary is now displayed for the uploaded dictionary on the Upload Dictionary screen after the upload dictionary process is completed. (AL-136514)

- The data dictionary upload now accepts the TSV file format. (AL-136379)

- Previously, we relied on object keys (names) to link objects using object set fields in the upload dictionary flow, which caused some performance challenges and issues identifying the right objects in case of duplicates. To address this, we added support for the object ID in the format ``objectid | ObjectKey(name)``. You can now provide the object ID or the name or both to link objects via the dictionary upload. When downloading the data dictionary file, we will include both the object id and the object key for each object set field value. (AL-127462)

Alation Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a "no special characters" password policy for the Alation Analytics database password: the password can't contain any special characters. (AL-138780)

- Now you can skip load tables from the subsequent ETL runs using a new **alation_conf** flag ``alation_analytics-v2.etl.skip_load_tables``. This setting can unblock all other ETL jobs if some jobs are failing. To add tables to this flag, use the following syntax: ``alation_conf alation_analytics-v2.etl.skip_load_tables -s '["users", "query"]'``. To reset the flag, use the following syntax: ``alation_conf alation_analytics-v2.etl.skip_load_tables -s '[]'.`` (AL-128081)

- *Cloud-native architecture* The ``alationanalyticsv2_entitlement_counts`` table has been renamed to ``license_usage`` to more accurately describe its purpose. Additionally, the following measures related to user license consumption have been added to the table:
    - ``num_licenses``—The number of licenses available.
    - ``pct_utilization``—The number of users as a percentage of available licenses.
    - ``pct_adoption``—The number of active users as a percentage of available licenses.

    This table is also now replicated to Alation Analytics on Snowflake. (AL-136878)

      .. note::

          The ``license_usage`` table is populated on Alation instances on Cloud-native architecture only. On customer-managed instances, this table is present but not populated.

Glossary Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``enable_glossary_terms_performance`` feature flag, which controls the performance enhancement for Glossaries, now defaults to enabled. The flag still remains in the flag list on the **Feature Configuration** page. If you had previously toggled it on and then off again, it will remain disabled after the upgrade to 2023.3.3. You can manually toggle it back on again to experience a performance improvement. (AL-136812)

Absolute User Session Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons, users will no longer be able to stay logged in for an indefinite period of time. A user session will be terminated forcing the user to re-login once the time limit for session duration is reached. The absolute user session timeout is configurable on the Authentication page of Admin Settings, using the field **Maximum Session Duration** (in hours). (AL-123328)

Alation API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom Field Value APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for ``api_resource``, ``api_resource_field``, and ``api_resource_folder`` object types in the Public Custom Field Value API and Public Custom Field Value Async API (Refer to `Custom Field Value Overview <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/custom-field-values-overview>`_ on Alation Developer Portal). (AL-134107)

- Fixed an issue with the Public Custom Field Value API where validation errors were not thrown correctly when using an unsupported object type (AL-134176).

Public API for SCIM Token Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for the API endpoint for SCIM token operations (Refer to `SCIM 2.0 API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/generatetoken>`_ on Alation Developer Portal). (AL-136805)

Cloud Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Cloud-native architecture*

- Re-enabled the admin UI for viewing active tasks which was previously disabled when this service launched due to some issues. (AL-124848)

- The License dashboard page now shows the contract expiration date. Previously, the license expiration date was displayed. In Alation, licenses are renewed every year until the contract expires. (AL-137415)

- Elasticache is now in use on instances on the cloud-native architecture. Alation components leveraging Elasticache have better performance by storing and retrieving frequently used data within Elasticache. (AL-107135)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an issue where after the upgrade to 2023.3.1, the query forms user experience for the Viewer role was hampered when the Obfuscate Literals setting was enabled (all literals became unavailable in the query form result). This fix returns query forms behavior to align with the behavior in Compose where a user with run (or edit) permissions on a query would see literals, even when literal obfuscation is turned on, as opposed to a viewer who would not see the literals. A user with only view permissions on a query would not see literals on any Alation page when obfuscation is turned on. (AL-136260)

- Fixed an issue when the dynamic multi-select widget did not show any error messages on query forms. (AL-137032).

PATCH RELEASE 2023.3.2.1
----------------------------

*build 17.2.1.55993*

*Released November 8, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for all Alation instance types: customer-managed (on-premise) and Alation Cloud Service.

- This patch release includes platform updates to support the enhanced user experience for configuring OCF connector settings, which will be available in upcoming connector releases, starting with the Snowflake OCF connector. (AL-137533)

- Fixed a Bulk Utility issue where an internal .csv file would become corrupted when users clicked the **Download** button on the Bulk Utility page. This issue occurred where the initial use of the Bulk Utility involved clicking **Download** as opposed to selecting a specific saved search, resulting in the generated .csv file missing the ``Search`` column and leading to a 500 error. (AL-136141)

RELEASE 2023.3.2
----------------------------

*build 17.2.0.55403*

*Released November 1, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for all Alation instance types: customer-managed (on-premise) and Alation Cloud Service.

Alation Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Authentication for RabbitMQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RabbitMQ component of Alation Analytics now requires basic authentication for incoming connections from other Alation components. The RabbitMQ password is auto-generated during the installation or upgrade of Alation Analytics. The password needs to be set in **alation_conf** via the ``alation_analytics-v2.rmq.config.password`` parameter before initializing the Alation Analytics database.

This is a one-time setup for customer-managed instances of Alation. Alation will perform this setup for Alation Cloud Service customers.

Object and User Counts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Object and user counts are now stored in Alation Analytics in the ``alation_analytics_v2_entitlementcounts`` table. The table is updated daily with a snapshot of all object usage across an Alation instance.

    .. note::

        For Alation Analytics Snowflake users: This data is not replicated into Snowflake in this release, but it will be synced starting from the next release (the November release).

Improvements for Third-Party BI Access via Snowflake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Cloud-native architecture*

Snowflake Password Requirements Enforced
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you have a connected Alation Analytics database in Snowflake, your Alation Analytics password must meet Snowflake's password requirements. This is now enforced in the Alation user interface under **Account Settings > DB Connections**. To create or update the password for the Alation Analytics data source, users will need to follow certain password policies imposed by Snowflake (a lowercase alphabet, an uppercase, a digit, and the length of eight characters).

Clear Analytics Data - Fixed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Snowflake database was not getting cleared when clearing up Alation Analytics using the **Clear Analytics Data** button. Now, the cleaning up of the database will be done asynchronously as part of a Celery task, and the button click will post a message to Celery and return success. (AL-125158)


Alation Anywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation Anywhere for Slack now shows rich previews for glossaries and terms.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have updated and expanded audit logging for important security-related events, such as updates to authentication settings, authorization changes, and user and group management updates. Authentication logs are written to **alation-events.log**.

Compose Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can now sort queries alphabetically by name in ascending and descending order.

- Compose now deletes blank queries after closing the query tab. In addition, on Sunday, Compose automatically deletes any blank queries from the past week.

- Embedded queries can now be executed in query forms.

- When query results are exported or downloaded in any way, Alation logs the event for auditing purposes. The logs are recorded to the ``alation-events.log`` file.

- Fixed an issue where the **Connection Settings** dialog didn't open when attempting to run a query with a connection error.

- The Query API now respects configuration settings that prevent query results from being exported or downloaded.

- Multi-select parameters in query forms can now have their value options defined with a pre-query. Once the pre-query has been run, query form users can select values based on the results of the pre-query. For usability purposes, pre-query results have an upper limit of 100 result items.

Connected Sheets OAuth Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Roles are kept separate for the username and SSO credentials so users will not see roles auto-populated inconsistently between the different credential forms.

- Error messages have been moved to the top so that they are visible without having to scroll.

- A "Connected" badge was added showing the credential that is being used.

- The credentials form now automatically expands and collapses.

Governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Dictionary upload has a new, streamlined interface and now runs asynchronously. Users should avoid quoting header names containing space characters to avoid issues with well-known CSV editors.

Data Dictionary download now includes a new first column, **al_datadict_item_properties**, which contains object types and object IDs for each object in the data dictionary. When updating an RDBMS object with a data dictionary, this column should not be modified. When migrating curation information from one instance to another, this column should be removed, as the object IDs may not be correct for the target instance.


Install and Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On customer-managed (on-premise) instances of Alation, you can now place the internal Alation database on the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance in your own AWS account. This capability provides the benefits of RDS to self-managed customers.

- Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.x, Ubuntu Linux 22, and Debian Linux 11 as base operating systems for installation of the on-premise Alation software package.

- The legacy tab—**Software Updates**—has been removed from Admin Settings.

Lineage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asset Grouping Icons for Datasource Cluster Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data source logos are now shown in the Compound Layout lineage diagrams for each data source group. Generic data source logos are used for virtual data sources and Custom DBs.

Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synonym Search On Cloud-Native Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synonym search is now supported in the cloud-native architecture.

New Public API for the Management of Synonyms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new public API has been added for the management of synonyms so that customers can customize synonym terms in their catalog searches. For more information, refer to `Search Overview <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/search-overview>`_ on Alation's Developer Portal.

User Management: Generate SCIM Tokens in the User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server Admins can now generate SCIM tokens on the **Admin Settings > Authentication** page, making it easier to maintain the connection between your identity provider and Alation. Server Admins will get alerts about SCIM token expiration. Email alerts will occur 15 days before expiration, 1 day before, on the day of expiration, and the day after expiration. Server Admins will also see a banner appear in the Alation interface 15 days before the token expires.

Connect Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zero Touch Agent - Downloadable Installers through Public API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installer packages for the Alation Agent can now be downloaded programmatically through the public Alation Agent API.

OCF Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HDFS OCF Connector—New!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HDFS OCF connector is now generally available (GA).

MicroStrategy OCF Connector—New!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MicroStrategy OCF connector is now generally available (GA).
The MicroStrategy OCF connector supports TLS and other features based on MicroStrategy REST APIs.

Salesforce OCF Connector—Limited Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Limited availability release of the Salesforce OCF connector which would be replacing the custom DB connector.

    - Known issue: The OAuth support for MDE requires manual token refresh upon expiration.

Bug Fixes for Multiple OCF Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Column profiling: Fixed a profiling error raised when profiling a column with more than 2,147,483,647 rows (AL-130007). Applies to OCF connectors:

    - **AWS Databricks OCF connector**
    - **Azure Databricks OCF connector**
    - **Redshift OCF connector**

- The JDBC URI is auto-updated to have ``useNativeQuery=0`` if not given in the URI. This fixes custom query sampling errors (AL-129772). Applies to OCF connectors:

    - **AWS Databricks OCF connector**
    - **Azure Databricks OCF connector**
    - **Databricks Unity Catalog OCF connector**
    - **Databricks Unity Catalog OCF connector**

- Removed the ``jtds`` prefix appended in ``sqlserverazure`` in the connector code (AL-134059). Applies to OCF connectors:

    - **Azure SQL DB OCF connector**
    - **SQL Server OCF connector**

Athena OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Getting query string from Batch API using query execution ID. (AL-127679)

- Removed the ``ORDER BY`` clause from the column profile queries (stats). (AL-133322)

AWS Glue OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgraded to the latest SDK and passing the Alation compatible version. (AL-132242)

Azure Blob Storage OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Azure Service Principal-based authentication feature is supported from Alation version 2023.3.1. (AL-119081, AL-133846)

Denodo OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed selective extraction and now the connector filters tables and columns based on the selected schema. (AL-126061)

EMR Presto OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue with dynamic sampling taking user credentials from the **General Settings** page. (AL-131731)

Google BigQuery OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue with child statements of create procedure query not being parsed. (AL-128150)

Redshift OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- We need to check the limit while accumulating/appending the string instead of at the end of the sequence to avoid unnecessary processing. (AL-133320)

- Removed temporary instance profile option from the **General Settings** page. (AL-130294)

Snowflake OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed extraction queries which caused an issue when we don’t have a catalog name in the JDBC URI and the selected Include/Exclude filter option was **all schemas except**. (AL-133694)

- Snowflake has custom streamer class for filter extraction and that doesn't handle validation exception similar to SDK’s streamer class. As part of the fix we added catch block to handle validation exception. (AL-134421)

Starburst Trino OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue with dynamic sampling taking user credentials from general settings page. (AL-134314)

Teradata OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Introduced the **Extract Schemas From DBASE** setting, enabled by default, allowing schema extraction from ``DBC.Dbase`` or ``DBC.DatabasesV`` based on permissions, providing a mechanism for scenarios with limited table access. In the absence of this support, MDE was failing if the service account did not have permissions for ``DBC.Databasesv``. (AL-133434)

Tableau OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Popularity for the Workbook and Report/View objects are now supported in Alation when using the Tableau OCF Connector.

Vertica OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Made a modification of the grammar type from ``ANSI`` to ``VERTICA``. Previously, when the ``ANSI`` grammar type was in use, certain SQL queries, such as ``SELECT * FROM TABLE LIMIT 10;``, didn't undergo proper parsing by Alation during QLI. With this fix, these types of queries now undergo successful parsing without encountering any errors. (AL-129496)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Governance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Revamped Dictionary Upload Flow: More performant and robust data dictionary upload flow is now enabled by default on all environments. (AL-134121)

Snowflake Tag Fixes for Policy Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Snowflake tags are removed from data dictionary during download as we do not support persisting tag value updates via data dictionary. (AL-131699)

- For the native Snowflake connector, the tooltip text for custom fields wasn't getting populated correctly. This has now been fixed for OCF as well. (AL-130336)

- In Snowflake, tags can have ``allowed_values`` set for them (see `Object Tagging <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging#specifying-tag-values>`_ in Snowflake documentation). Previously, during MDE, the values in a tag's ``allowed_values`` field were not populated as Custom Fields. However, when tags were attached to objects with a value, those values got populated. Now, MDE is fixed to get the ``allowed_values`` of Snowflake tags as Custom Fields values. (AL-130309)

Term & Glossaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed an issue causing corruption of article snapshots when articles are edited using Bulk Utility. (AL-133010)

- Fixed an issue that resulted in a new row when copying and pasting into a table within an article. (AL-133281)

User Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Suspending users flow is optimized to clean up the active session data in a background task. In some situations, there are 3-4M session entries that previously caused the ``504`` timeouts. While the background task sweeps and cleans up sessions, a middleware change further blocks these users and prevents their logins for security. (AL-122130)


PATCH RELEASE 2023.3.1.2
---------------------------

*build 17.1.2.54864*

*Released October 25, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for all Alation instance types: customer-managed (on-premise) and Alation Cloud Service.

- In a recent update of Datadog Agent, a configuration change was omitted. This resulted in email alerts being sent every 15 seconds, which led to an excessive volume of notifications for Alation administrators. With this fix, email alerts will be sent based on your configuration in **alation_conf**, ensuring that their frequency aligns with your expectations. (AL-134151)

PATCH RELEASE 2023.3.1.1
---------------------------

*build 17.1.1.54419*

*Released October 20, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for Alation Cloud Service instances on the cloud-native architecture.

- Fixed an issue related to the Okta SCIM integration with Alation. Previously, if a user was deleted from the Okta SCIM app and subsequently re-added, their reactivation in Alation did not occur as expected. The issue was indicated by the following error in the ``scim-debug.log`` file: *Exception - InternalServer: Unexpected error in updating SCIM user with id <...>*. With this fix, users who are removed and then re-added to the SCIM app in Okta will now be automatically re-provisioned and re-activated in Alation. (AL-134886)


RELEASE 2023.3.1
-------------------

*build 17.1.0.52371*

*Released October 5, 2023*

.. note::

    This release is available for all Alation instance types: customer-managed (on-premise) and Alation Cloud Service.

Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Granular Download and Export Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduced user and group-level permissions for downloading and exporting query results to ensure that only authorized users and groups can export and download the data. Previously, Data Source Admins could enable or disable the Export and Download feature for all users of a data source. Now, they can select individual users and/or groups and grant them the ability to export and download. The access settings are available:

    - On the **Compose** tab of the Settings page for an OCF data source
    - On the **General Settings** tab of the Settings page for a native data source or Custom DB.

Query Export Alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added status alerts for the Export and Download feature in Compose. Compose will show an alert if a download gets stuck or cannot be completed. You will also be informed about the progress status (number of rows downloaded so far). This feature can be enabled from the Compose preferences.

Ability to Disable Automatic Connections to Data Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Server Admins can now disable automatic connections to data sources in Compose. With automatic connections disabled, Compose won't use the expired credentials to make connections automatically and cause the data source to lock up the account.

Sort Query Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can now apply sorting to query groups.

Multiple Compose Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`Compose Bug Fixes <compose-bug-fixes>` below.

Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation now searches for matches across all text fields (picker, multi-picker, rich text custom fields) on term tables.

Governance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Dictionary download now includes a new first column, **al_datadict_item_properties**, which contains object types and object IDs for each object in the data dictionary. When updating an RDBMS object with a data dictionary, this column should not be modified. When migrating curation information from one instance to another, this column should be removed, as the object IDs may not be correct for the target instance.


Connect Platform

Query Log Ingestion Pipeline Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stabilized the performance of query log ingestion (QLI) by restricting a single QLI job to run for seven days or less. Multiple QLI jobs can still be submitted to account for more days as an alternative. If a QLI job is submitted for more than seven days, an error message will be displayed in the QLI job submission UI and referenced in the QLI job history page and the job will not run until resolved. If any exceptions are required to loosen these restrictions and submitting multiple QLI jobs is not an option, please request an exception via a Support ticket.

Tableau OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 1.6.7.6780
''''''''''''''''''''''

- Removed the settings **Disable auto pagination**, **Number of workbooks to return per request**, **Number of datasources returned per request**, **Number of connections to return per request**, and **Number of fields/columns to return per request** from the connector settings page. Pagination is now always enabled. (AL-131539, AL-129442)

- Added the ability to enable or disable the extraction of auto-generated embedded data sources (**Enable MDE for auto-generated embedded data sources**). (AL-132136, AL-125129)

- The REST API calls will now all have a timeout to prevent latency issues leading to extremely long extraction times. (AL-129663)

- Fixed an issue with extraction where users observed duplicate and stale objects in the catalog. Duplicates or stale objects will no longer be created. (AL-129311)

- Fixed an issue where a failure in the popularity API request led to an error during extraction. Added logic to correctly handle empty popularity API responses. (AL-130126)

Databricks on AWS OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 2.1.3.5925
''''''''''''''''''''''

Upgraded the Databricks driver in the connector to the the latest version. In this driver version, the JDBC URI protocol was changed from ``spark://`` to ``databricks://``. (AL-123135)

Databricks on Google Cloud OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 2.0.0.5925
'''''''''''''''''''''

Upgraded the Databricks driver in the connector to the the latest version. In this driver version, the JDBC URI protocol was changed from ``spark://`` to ``databricks://``. (AL-123141)

Databricks Unity Catalog OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 2.0.4.6984
'''''''''''''''''''''

Fixed an issue where a table that was previously extracted and later excluded from extraction, was still displayed, but with the *Deleted from the data source* message. Selective extraction now properly filters catalogs, schemas, tables, and columns, and no longer contains objects from catalogs and schemas that are not included in extraction. (AL-126886)

Amazon S3 OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.8.6.6821
''''''''''''''''''''''

Fixed an issue with extracting folders that don't have a name, for example, folders that are stored with a ``/`` and no explicit name. Added the ability to extract the S3 folders with no name but having contents. Previously, we didn’t show such folders on Alation. (AL-128411)

.. _azure-blob-connector:

Azure Blob Storage OCF Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 2.4.1.7072
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Python Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgraded the internal Python language libraries to a newer version to take advantage of the new, more secure, functionality.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _compose-bug-fixes:

Compose
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The parameter **Always show column names** in the **Results** section of Compose Settings previously only applied to query runs. Now, it has been extended to query exports. (AL-127968)

- Previously, changing the query owner of a scheduled query didn't change the owner of the schedule. After this fix, a change to query ownership will also change the ownership of the schedule. (AL-130402)

- Fixed an issue where **My Queries**, **Drafts**, and **By Query Group** lists on the **Open Query** screen did not include the unpublished queries that a user had access to. Now, users will see all of their queries, including unpublished ones in these query lists. (AL-124378)

- Fixed an issue where the **Password** field in the **Connection Settings** dialog was not clear when users tried to create a second new connection. (AL-101879)

- Fixed an issue where the **Format** action could break the formatting for some queries. In query variables, both keys and values are now permitted to be case-insensitive. (AL-94131)

- Fixed an issue with the OAuth authentication for OCF Snowflake data sources where the Connection Settings dialog showed the *Authentication Successful* message when the access and refresh tokens were expired. Now, the *Authentication Failure* message will be correctly displayed when token expiration happens. (AL-100851)

- Removed the OAuth authentication status notifications that were shown in a slide-out in the bottom right corner of the Compose user interface. OAuth authentication status messages will be now displayed in the Connection Settings dialog. (AL-126545)

- Fixed an issue where HTML sanitation incorrectly recognized some HTML tags within SQL. Only script tags will now be sanitized. (AL-131716)

- Fixed an issue where query form results did not obfuscate literals while the data source had the **Obfuscate Literals** setting enabled. (AL-115548)

- Fixed a bug in the Compose user interface where un-publishing and then re-publishing a query caused the corresponding query version to appear as a parentless version in **Version History**. (AL-36005)

- Fixed an issue where a query schedule could be saved without providing the connection information. (AL-121813)

- Fixed an issue where the Conversation pull-out icon did not appear on the query form catalog page. (AL-133248)

- Fixed an issue with the **Load More** button for queries on the **Queries** tab under schema and table catalog objects where pressing this button did not upload more queries into the interface. (AL-131497)

- When the service account is configured with key pair authentication for Snowflake, the data associated with it is being used for Compose connections. The key pair parameters should not be used for Compose connections and the change in this ticket does an extra check to ensure this. (AL-128080)

Alation Analytics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed an issue where the ``ts_updated`` column was not updated when custom templates were modified. (AL-114792)

- Fixed an issue where the current timezone of a query schedule was not extracted into Alation Analytics. Now you'll be able to query the timezone of the scheduled query from the Alation Analytics data source. This can help in estimating the exact runs of the cron jobs handling the queries. To retrieve this information, make use of the ``schedule_cron_tz`` column in the query table. (AL-119622)

Glossaries and Articles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a performance issue where the loading of linked terms on the glossary details page took excessive time. The fix ensures much quicker responses to hydrate both Glossary Hub and Glossary Term tables. It is controlled by the **alation_conf** parameter  ``alation.feature_flags.enable_glossary_terms_performance`` that is disabled by default and needs to be enabled if you are affected by this issue. (AL-115695)

- Fixed an issue where the object titles mentioned in the description were missing on the hover-over the **Columns** field on catalog pages of table objects. Now, the full description will be displayed. (AL-129977)

- Previously, there was a page length control on the **Term Glossary** membership dialog. It defaulted to ``5``, and could be adjusted to show up to 25 glossaries per page. From Alation version 2023.1.6, this page size control was no longer visible, but the default page size of five could not be changed. Now, fixed: the page length can again be controlled by users in the user interface. (AL-132113)

- Fixed an issue with Bulk Utility where domains with an ampersand (``&``) in the name were not migrated. Alation now allows the domains with an ampersand to be successfully applied to terms during migration from articles using Bulk Utility. (AL-132214)

- Fixed an issue where the rich text editor didn't retain formatting. Users can now choose if they want to keep the formatting from outlook or discard it. (AL-132418)

- Fixed an issue where suspended users were not displayed as ``GONE`` on the **Access** dialog for object-level permissions–⁠enabled objects. (AL-133111)

Data Dictionary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Users will now be able to upload a data dictionary file containing rich text fields without experiencing the *Unexpected Error* caused by the presence of rich text fields in the data dictionary file while generating a preview. Additionally, we introduced the **alation_conf** parameter ``hydrate_rich_text_field_values_on_data_dictionary_preview_ui`` (disabled by default).  It controls whether the existing values of rich text fields should be hydrated by showing the corresponding display text for each of the mentions on the preview screen. (AL-129392)

Other Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Addressed an issue where the **Subdomains** field was not available for addition to the domain template after it was deleted. Alation now prevents users from removing of the Subdomains and Domain Users components from the domain template. (AL-127364)

- Made a performance enhancement to speed up retrieval of object sets. You can still return to the previous way of retrieving object sets by disabling the **alation_conf** flag ``DEV_enable_object_set_value_visible_v2`` (enabled by default). (AL-112701)

- Fixed an issue where file system object count reporting query used up lot of disk space. Optimized the query to avoid excessive disk usage. (AL-132803)

- Fixed a behavior where LMS history files were deleted when any error happened during processing. (AL-132602)

Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flexible Query Result Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure Alation instances comply with customer security policies, this feature provides more control and flexibility to datasource admins on how query results can be shared. Datasource admins have three levels of control on whether the sharing the query result is allowed or not: No sharing is permitted, only private sharing is allowed, or allowing private and public sharing. Datasource admins can also control if users have the ability to preserve query results without automatic deletion

Compose Compatibility with Query Service-enabled OCF Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compose is now compatible with Query Service enabled Starburst Trino and SybaseIQ OCF Connectors, so that clients using these data sources can migrate to these OCF Connectors.

Compose Export Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When Exporting a query execution, Compose will show an alert message containing the title of the query and the number of result rows exported upon each completed query statement, so that users are informed if the Export is successful.

- Added possibility to assign group profiles to conversations.


Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata Extraction based on Cross-Account IAM Role-based Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for cross-account authentication is needed for Metadata Extraction (MDE) between the Alation instance and AWS resources that might reside in different AWS accounts. With IAM role-based authentication, customers do not have to enter IAM user credentials in the Alation Catalog. Authentication is performed based on trust set up between an IAM role in the Alation account and an IAM role set up in the customer’s AWS account where the AWS resource is running. Metadata extraction and query log ingestion from the following OCF AWS connectors: S3, Glue, Athena, and Redshift, are supported by this feature.

API Authentication using JWT - *Cloud-native architecture only*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

APIs can now be secured with JWT token-based authentication in addition to using opaque tokens. With this new authentication, customers can register an external application with Alation and use the JWT tokens assigned to the application for authentication and authorization.


Cloud Configuration - *Cloud-native architecture only*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Cloud-Native Architecture Service: Entitlement and License Management Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compound Layout Feature Improvements (E2E Column-Level Tracing/Beta Launch)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compound layout feature, which has been available behind feature flags since 2022.4, is now available as a Beta offering to all customers in all environments. The compound layout feature groups data sources, e.g. Snowflake, separately from other data sources, e.g. Tableau, to provide focus on data movement for certain objects, e.g. tables, across these data sources. This feature has been enhanced to drill down from data sources to the column level with the ability to trace columns upstream and downstream across data source groups to capture a holistic E2E lineage view. (AL-126630)

KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------

- The upgrade to 2023.3.1 or a later minor version of 2023.3 may fail due to Postgres failing to start. The issue affects some of the Alation Cloud Service instances that have not been migrated to the cloud-native architecture and the on-premise instances that used a custom approach to the installation and installed the Postgres component in a Docker container. This issue can be addressed through a workaround: :doc:`/admins/Troubleshooting/20233UpgradeFailsPostgresDoesNotStart`. A fix will be provided in a future Alation version.
