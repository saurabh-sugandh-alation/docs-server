Failover to Secondary
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation only supports manual failover from Primary to Secondary.

.. important::

   The failover command is non-reversible. 

Considerations
--------------------------

Consider the following information before performing the failover:

-  Keys and cluster_hosts are preserved.
-  After the failover command is issued on the Secondary, it places
   itself in standalone mode.
-  If you try to rebuild the cluster, it will result in the target
   host being attached as a Secondary.
-  A Search index will take several hours to rebuild after a failover.
-  If you intend to re-use the old Primary server as Secondary, all data
   will be lost.
-  Disable scheduled queries on Secondary before failover.

Running Failover to Secondary
---------------------------------

To failover from Primary to Secondary:

From the Secondary run:

.. code-block:: Bash

      sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell
      alation_action cluster_failover
