Use these steps to split the HA Pair and revert the primary and
secondary instances to the standalone mode:

-  This action can be run on Primary and Secondary nodes
-  The HA configuration can be rebuilt later.

To revert the cluster to the standalone mode:

#. SSH to the host of the primary node.
#. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: console

       sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

3. Run the following command to revert the host to the standalone mode:

    .. code-block:: console

       alation_action cluster_enter_standalone_mode

     To exit the shell, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

       exit

4. Repeat the process for the Secondary node to be reset to the standalone mode.
