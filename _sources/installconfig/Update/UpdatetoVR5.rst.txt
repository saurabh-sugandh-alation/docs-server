Update Alation to V R5 (5.9.x)
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

The process of updating Alation to V R5 from an older release depends on
your current release number.

If you want to update from versions before V R2 (5.4.x), and namely:

-  4.8.x
-  V R1 (5.0.x)

Read the information in `Updating from Before V R2`_.

If you want to update from versions:

-  V R2 (5.4.x)
-  V R3 (5.6.x)
-  V R4 (5.8.x)

then refer to `Updating from V R2, V R3 and V R4`_.

Updating from Before V R2
-------------------------

If your current release is 4.8.x or V R1 (5.0.x),then updating to V R5
will have to be performed in three steps.

Step 1: Update to V R4 (latest available patch version)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you will need to update to:

-  **V R4 (latest available patch version)**

.. note::

   In your Alation version, one of the internal components is *MongoDB* .  It is used for storing Alation server data, such as, for example, the results of Compose queries.

   Starting with version  *V R2 (5.4.x)*, Alation began to migrate the
   server data off MongoDB to a PostgreSQL database. This transition has
   been happening in the background and is complete in *V R5 (5.9.x)*. In
   V R5, the MongoDB component is entirely removed from the
   Alation package.

   This transition is a major architectural change in the Alation
   application, and, unfortunately, it does not allow us to support a
   seamless update from your version to V R5.

   The intermediary stage of updating to V R4 (latest available patch)
   is required for Alation to start and complete the transition from
   MongoDB to PostgreSQL as the internal server database.


Plan your update to V R4 using the following information in Help Center:

- General Alation update information: :doc:`Update Alation <../../installconfig/Update/index>`.
- :doc:`Release-Specific Update Pre-checks <../../installconfig/Update/ReleaseUpdatePrechecks>` : this instruction does apply to your Alation instance, follow those checks to prepare for the update.
- The update instructions for your instance type:

      -  :doc:`Manual Software Update - Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`
      -  :doc:`Update on HA Pair (4.7 and Above) <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`

- Important :doc:`Update Safety Best Practice <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateSafetyBestPractice>`

When you successfully update Alation, you can move to the next step.

Step 2: Allow Time For MongoDB Transition to Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use your updated R4 instance over at least one weekend. In the
background, Alation will start and complete the server data migration
off MongoDB to PostgreSQL.

After the migration is complete, you can go to the next stage and update
to V R5.

.. note::

   V R4 comes with the ``replace_mongo_with_postgres`` parameter in ``alation_conf`` that is set to ``True`` by default. On a Saturday after the update, Alation should automatically trigger the MongoDB migration script that copies the Alation server data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. In a regular scenario, this migration should be completed over one weekend. If it requires a longer time, the process will be working until the migration is finished successfully.

   You can check *mongo-data-migration.log* at **/opt/alation/site/logs** to
   make sure that migration is complete.

Step 3: Update to V R5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plan your update to V R5 using the information in Help Center and
then update your instance:

- General Alation update information: :doc:`Update Alation <../../installconfig/Update/index>`

- The update instructions for your instance type:

    -  :doc:`Manual Software Update - Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`
    -  :doc:`Update on HA Pair <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`

- Important :doc:`Update Safety Best Practice <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateSafetyBestPractice>`

.. important::

    You might see the following message:

    ``The installer will abort until migration job from MongoDB to Postgres has succeeded.``

    This means the data migration has not been completed yet or completed
    with errors.

Updating from V R2, V R3 and V R4
----------------------------------

In *V R5 (5.9.x)*, the MongoDB component is entirely removed from the Alation package.

Regular Scenario: MongoDB Migration is Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In releases V R2 (5.4.x), V R3 (5.6.x), and R4 (5.8.x), migration off
MongoDB has happened in the background if in your instance
the ``replace_mongo_with_postgres`` parameter
in ``alation_conf`` was set to ``True`` (default setting). On a
Saturday after the installation of or update to any of these releases,
Alation should have triggered the MongoDB migration script to copy the
Alation server data from MongoDB to PostreSQL. In a regular scenario,
the migration should are completed over one weekend. Even if it
required a longer time, the process should are active until the
migration has finished successfully.

You can check *mongo-data-migration.log* at **/opt/alation/site/logs**,
if it is available, to make sure that migration has finished. After
that, Plan your update to V R5 using the information in Help
Center then update your instance. There are no specific steps for
the  update to V R5 if MongoDB migration is completed:

- General Alation update information: :doc:`Update Alation <../../installconfig/Update/index>`
- The update instructions for your instance type:
-  :doc:`Manual Software Update - Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`
-  :doc:`Update on HA Pair <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`
- Important :doc:`Update Safety Best Practice <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateSafetyBestPractice>`

Irregular Scenario: MongoDB Migration is Not Complete or You Are Not Sure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``replace_mongo_with_postgres`` parameter was previously reset
to ``False`` in your Alation instance, the migration process may not
are completed.

To check on the current parameter value,

1. Enter the Alation shell:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

2. View the current parameter value in Alation conf:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alation_conf replace_mongo_with_postgres

   If there is
   no ``mongo-data-migration.log`` at ``/opt/alation/site/logs`` or it
   does not have information that migration is completed, or you
   are not sure if and when the ``replace_mongo_with_postgres
   parameter``  value was changed, there is a chance that when you
   try to update, the V R5 updater will exit with the following error:

   ``The installer will abort until migration job from MongoDB to Postgres has succeeded.``

   If this happens in your instance, you can:

   - Set the parameter ``replace_mongo_with_postgres parameter`` to ``True``
   - Let your instance work over the first weekend after this change and, probably, a little longer into the week.
   - Check ``mongo-data-migration.log`` at ``/opt/alation/site/logs`` to confirm that the MongoDB migration has finished successfully.
   - Attempt update to R5 in the next week. Plan your update to V R5 using the information in Help Center then update your instance.

Referential Integrity Warnings During Update
--------------------------------------------

This applies to all releases. Note that during update to V
R5, you may observe data integrity warnings in the ``installer.log``. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   WARNING SemiStructured object with path=[u'Collection Item'] does not have a corresponding DocSchema object

.. note::

  These warnings are not fatal, are caused by the R5 codebase and do not affect the update. You can ignore these warnings.
