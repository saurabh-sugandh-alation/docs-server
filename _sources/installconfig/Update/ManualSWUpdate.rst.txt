Manual Software Update for Standalone Systems
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. note::

    It is recommended to update to the *latest available* patch version of a release.


This article describes manual steps for updating Alation on Standalone systems when the Alation instance is not deployed on a High Availability pair:

    - If your Alation instance runs on a machine that uses the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux or AWS Linux operating systems, use the `Updating on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AWS Linux or CentOS`_  section below.

    - If it runs on a machine with the Ubuntu or Debian operating systems, use the `Updating on Ubuntu`_ section below.

If Alation is installed with the HA Pair configuration, refer to
the :doc:`Upgrade on an HA Pair Configuration <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`.

Configuring Network for Reporting Usage Data
----------------------------------------------

If you have not done so yet, configure your network to allow
communicating with the Alation cloud. This is required for reporting
usage data to Alation automatically. For details on reporting usage data and why it
is important to Alation, see :doc:`Reporting Usage <../../admins/AdminSettings/ReportUsage>`.

The time before an update may be a good moment to do this
change because it enables usage data reporting in your updated Alation instance.

To configure the network for automatic reporting, make sure the
following ports are open:

================= ============= ============= ==========================
Function          Direction     Ports         Destination
================= ============= ============= ==========================
Usage Stats       outbound      TCP 443       Alation Cloud: 52.4.59.229
================= ============= ============= ==========================

Preparing For Update
-----------------------

- Alation recommends updating your staging server first, verifying there are no issues, and then updating the Production server.
- Verify your System Admin has SUDO privileges on the system when Alation is installed.
- Verify your System Admin has access to the Alation Customer Portal and can download the Alation build.
- Confirm system upgradeability by validating that a minimum of 15 GB space is free at **/opt/alation/**:

      - On the host, outside the Alation chroot, run:

        .. code-block:: Bash

            df -h

        The output will show the used and available disk space for the disks. Find the main data disk: it is usually called **/data**. Find the number in the **Avail** column. This number should be equal or more than 15 GB:

        .. code-block:: Bash

              [root@C74X ~]# df -h

              Filesystem              Size Used   Avail Use% Mounted on
              /dev/mapper/centos-root 44G   17G   27G   38%   /
              /dev/sdc1               69G   2.2G  67G   4%    /BACKUP
              /dev/sdb1               44G   11G   34G   24%   /DATA


- Inform yourself on any release-specific or configuration-specific update checks that apply to your instance.

- Check permissions on the folder **extra_config** at **/opt/alation/site/config/extra_config** (inside the Alation shell).

      The permissions should be set to **755**.

      .. code-block:: Bash

            ls -al  /opt/alation/site/config/

      Example output:

      .. image:: ../../_static/Update_Check_extra_config.png
            :width: 350px


      If you see other permissions on **extra_config**, change to 755:

      .. code-block:: Bash

            sudo chmod 755 /opt/alation/site/config/extra_config


- Verify you have a valid Alation backup. For details on backup and restore, refer to :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/index`.
- For VM-hosted systems, Alation recommends you take a VM snapshot.
- For all systems, if you can take a snapshot of the host server with the vendor-provided tools, do so, too.
- Exit all active Alation shell sessions. If you are not sure all sessions are closed, restart Alation to clear all old shell sessions.

Updating on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AWS Linux or CentOS
----------------------------------------------------------

To update Alation on a machine running on RedHat Enterprise Linux, AWS Linux, or CentOS operating system:

#. Download the RPM install file from the Alation `Customer Portal <https://customerportal.alationdata.com>`_.
#. Copy the RPM file to the host server where Alation is installed to a location accessible from outside of the Alation shell.
#. Validate the file:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rpm -K  <path_to_file>

    .. note::

        Good response: **sha1 md5 OK**

        Bad Response: **sha1 md5 NOT OK**

    If the file is corrupted, download the file again and make sure the ``md5`` of the file matches the ``md5`` in the Customer Portal.

4. On the host system, unpackage the RPM from outside of the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo rpm -Uvh alation-####.rpm

    ``####`` represents the Alation version number in the RPM file name that uses
    the ``x.y.z.nnnn`` format,  where ``x`` = major, ``y`` = minor, ``z`` = patch, and ``nnnn`` =
    build, for example: ``alation-5.17.2.118938.rpm``

    For example:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo rpm -Uvh alation-4.14.7.20232.rpm

    .. note::

        If you receive an error ``headerRead failed: hdr data: BAD, no. of bytes(...) out of range`` at this step, troubleshoot using recommendations in :doc:`RPM Installation Error During Update <../../admins/Troubleshooting/RPMInstallationErrorDuringUpdate>`

5. On the host system, run the update action from outside of the Alation shell:

     .. code-block:: Bash

         sudo /etc/init.d/alation update

6. You can monitor the progress of the update by tailing the installer log file (this path is outside the Alation shell) in a separate terminal window:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        tail -f  /opt/alation/<alation-####>/var/log/installer.log

    Where <alation-####> stands for the version of Alation you are updating to.

    .. note::

       The ``sudo /etc/init.d/alation update`` command may take several hours, therefore, we advise that you run it with ``nohup`` or in a Screen session.

7. Note that after successfully completing the update, you may need to perform a number of post-update steps. The need for post-upgrade steps depends on the Alation version and the Alation instance configuration. Check the update instructions for the specific release if post-update steps are required.


Updating on Ubuntu
------------------

To update Alation on a machine running on the Ubuntu operating system:

#. Download the .deb file from the Alation `Customer Portal <https://customerportal.alationdata.com>`_. When downloading, note down the MD5 hash for the package. It is displayed on the download page under the package information.
#. Copy the .deb file to the server where Alation is installed.
#. Verify the downloaded file by checking that the output of the `md5sum` command for this file matches the MD5 hash that you noted down from the Customer Portal page:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        md5sum <path_to_downloaded_file>

4. On the host system, run the .deb update from outside of the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo dpkg -i alation-####.deb

Where ``alation-####.deb`` stands for the .deb file you downloaded, and #### represent the Alation version number in the ``x.y.z.nnnn`` format (``x`` = major, ``y`` = minor, ``z`` = patch, and ``nnnn`` = build, for example: ``alation-5.17.2.118938.deb``).

5. On the host system, run the update action from outside of the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation update

6. You can monitor the progress of the update by tailing the installer
   log file (path outside the Alation shell):

    .. code-block:: Bash

        tail -f /opt/alation/<alation-####>/var/log/installer.log

    Where <alation-####> stands for the version number you are updating to.

    .. note::

        The ``sudo /etc/init.d/alation update`` command may take several hours, therefore, we advise that you run it with ``nohup`` or in a Screen session.

7. Note that after successfully completing the update, you may need to perform a number of post-update steps. The need for post-upgrade steps depends on the Alation version and the Alation instance configuration. Check the update instructions for the specific release if post-update steps are required.

Troubleshooting Manual Update
-------------------------------

Make sure that:

-  Your Authentication Token is valid. It can be found in the installation link using Customer Portal in the email you received about the new build in the **" "** after **Token:** under the .deb filetype.
-  The URL from Customer Portal is valid. A common error is missing the **s** after **http** (``https:// ....``) in the URL.
