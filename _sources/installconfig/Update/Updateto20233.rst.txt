Update Alation to 2023.3
======================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

2023.3 Update Version Dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Alation supports a direct update to version 2023.3.x from the following previous versions:

    - 2023.1.x
    - 2022.4.x


Version 2022.3.x and Older
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct update to 2023.3.x is not supported from version 2022.3 and older versions. First, update Alation to a version that supports the update to 2023.3.x using the update instructions specific to your release. Then perform a second update to 2023.3.x.

2023.3 Release-Specific Information
-----------------------------------------

    .. note::

        The full list of new features is available in :doc:`/releases/releasenotes/ReleaseNotes20233`.


Postgres Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Postgres component (the internal PostgreSQL database) was upgraded from version **13.8** to version **13.11** to take advantage of improvements and bug fixes in the newer version. No manual action is required from Alation admins as the database version upgrade happens automatically during the Alation update.


Alation Analytics PostgreSQL Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alation Analytics database was upgraded from version **13.8** to version **13.11**. No additional manual actions are required from Alation admins as the Alation Analytics database version upgrade happens automatically during the update of the Alation Analytics application.

Alation Analytics: Basic Authentication for RabbitMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Applies from version 2023.3.2*

The RabbitMQ component of Alation Analytics V2 now requires basic authentication for incoming connections from other Alation components.

    .. important::

          The RabbitMQ password will be auto-generated during the update of Alation Analytics V2. Before you can initialize the Alation Analytics V2 database after the update, you must set this password in the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation_analytics-v2.rmq.config.password``. This is a one-time task that must be completed as part of the Alation Analytics V2 update steps.


Support for Larger Volumes of Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ve made some updates to the Alation database schema to support larger volumes of metadata. This means you can now ingest more metadata on a frequent basis without running into issues with integer overflow. Note that the migrations during the upgrade could add an additional 30 minutes depending on the volume of your metadata.


Update Known Issues
-------------------------------

Compatibility Issue with Alation Version 2023.3.1 or Higher for FIPS-Enabled Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, systems with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode enabled are not compatible with Alation version 2023.3.1 or higher. On FIPS-enabled systems, the upgrade to 2023.3.1 or higher will fail with the following error: *ValueError: [digital envelope routines: EVP_DigestInit_ex] disabled for FIPS*.

For those affected, we recommend these options:

- Remain on your current version until the issue is resolved.
- Consider upgrading to a version that is newer than your current version but remains below version 2023.3.1.

If you have further questions about this issue, please contact your Alation account executive.

Use Cluster Splitting for HA Pair Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alation update of an HA pair without splitting the cluster fails. We recommend upgrading HA instances using the cluster splitting upgrade method until this issue is resolved.

Index Row Size Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If during the upgrade you run into the error below, refer to `this troubleshooting article in Alation’s Knowledge Base <https://help.alation.com/s/article/The-upgrade-to-Alation-version-2023-3-is-failing-due-to-the-error-psycopg2-errors-ProgramLimitExceeded-The-index-row-size-of-2712-exceeds-the-maximum-limit-of-2704-for-index-rosemeta-attributevalue-attr-id-value-5fee90cc-uniq>`_. Contact Alation Support if you require help with this issue or if you have questions about any of the troubleshooting steps.

    .. code-block:: Bash

          psycopg2.errors.ProgramLimitExceeded: index row size 2712 exceeds
          btree version 4 maximum 2704 for index "rosemeta_attributevalue_attr_id_value_5fee90cc_uniq"
          DETAIL:  Index row references tuple (304577,3) in relation "rosemeta_attributevalue".
          HINT:  Values larger than 1/3 of a buffer page cannot be indexed.
          Consider a function index of an MD5 hash of the value, or use full text indexing.

Upgrade Fails for Dockerized Postgres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The upgrade to 2023.3.1 or a later minor version of 2023.3 may fail if you have a custom deployment of Alation where you had dockerized the Postgres component or had made changes to the ``/etc/passwd`` file (added or removed users). The upgrade on such instances fails due to Postgres failing to start and an error in the Postgres logs similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: Bash

          runuser: warning: cannot change directory to /home/postgres: No such file or directory
          postmaster: could not access directory "/var/lib/pgsql/13/data": Permission denied


You can apply a workaround described in :doc:`/admins/Troubleshooting/20233UpgradeFailsPostgresDoesNotStart`.


Update Alation to 2023.3.x
------------------------------------

Use the steps in this section to update Alation to 2023.3.x from versions 2023.1.x and 2022.4.x.

    .. note::

        If you are updating from release 2022.4.x and skipping release 2023.1, review the information specific to release 2023.1 in the corresponding release notes.

            - :doc:`/releases/releasenotes/ReleaseNotes20231`

Step 1: Scan Postgres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../shared/UpdateScanPostgres.rst


Step 2: Verify Backup Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have a valid latest Alation backup.


Step 3: Update the Alation Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update instructions:

    - :doc:`Manual Software Update for Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`

    - Update on the HA pair:

        - with splitting the HA cluster: :doc:`Update HA Pair with Cluster Splitting <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateHAPairwithClusterSplitting>`

            .. note::

                See `Use Cluster Splitting for HA Pair Update`_ under **Update Known Issues** for this release.


Step 4: Update Alation Connector Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step applies if you are using Open Connector Framework (OCF) and OCF connectors.

.. include:: ../../shared/UpdateACM.rst


Step 5: Update Alation Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step applies if you are using the Alation Analytics application.

Use the steps in :doc:`/installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/UpdateAlationAnalyticsV2` to update the Alation Analytics application. Please take note of the change in `Alation Analytics: Basic Authentication for RabbitMQ`_.

Step 6: Take a Full Manual Backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step applies if you have updated Alation from 2022.4.x to 2023.3. The upgrade from 2022.4.x skips release 2023.1, where the default backup tool was changed to pgBackRest. If you have updated Alation from 2023.1 to 2023.3, this section does not apply and you can skip it.

Take :ref:`a full manual backup <create-manual-backup>` to ensure that you have the first full backup of the updated instance taken with **pgBackRest**.


Step 7: Run Alation Analytics Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step applies if you are using Alation Analytics and have updated Alation and Alation Analytics from 2022.4.x to 2023.3. If you have updated Alation and Alation Analytics from 2023.1 to 2023.3, this section does not apply and you can skip it.

In 2023.1, we optimized the migrations of the database which were slowing down the upgrade of the Alation Analytics app. To apply the change, run the two scripts described below. In case of the HA pair configuration, run the scripts on the primary server.

1. Enter the Alation shell. You should be in the Alation shell to tail the log files and to run the scripts.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell


2. Make sure that the Alation Analytics ETL process is not running. The scripts should not be executed when the ETL process is running. You can check this by logging in to Alation, navigating to **Admin Settings > Monitor > Active Tasks** and making sure that the Alation Analytics ETL (alation_analytics_v2.tasks.etl_manager.ETLManager) job is not listed as an active task. Alternatively, you can use the tail command on the ``celery-alationanalytics_error.log`` file from the Alation shell. If Alation Analytics ETL is running, the log will be printing messages similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        {"message": "ETL job manager has been triggered to run.", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.644434Z", "level": "INFO"}
        {"message": "Created channel=1", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.651979Z", "level": "INFO"}
        {"message": "Starting TimePeriodExtractJob", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.654666Z", "level": "INFO"}
        {"message": "Starting UserExtractJob", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.685582Z", "level": "INFO"}
        {"message": "Starting AlationGroupExtractJob", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.725311Z", "level": "INFO"}
        {"message": "Starting UserGroupMembershipExtractJob", "timestamp": "2023-08-25T09:50:31.761310Z", "level": "INFO"}

To tail the log:

    .. code-block:: Bash

	tail -f /opt/alation/site/logs/celery-alationanalytics_error.log

After ensuring that the ETL process is not running, from the Alation shell, change the user to ``alation``.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo su alation

3. Navigate to the directory **/opt/alation/django/alation_analytics_v2/one_off_scripts/**.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        cd /opt/alation/django/alation_analytics_v2/one_off_scripts/

4. Run the flags script with the command below. The logs will be redirected to the ``reconcile_flag.log`` file.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        nohup python -u reconcile_flag.pyc >> reconcile_flag.log &

5. This command will launch a process with a PID. Save the PID value as you may need it. You can monitor this process by either tailing the corresponding log inside of the Alation shell or checking on the corresponding PID outside of the Alation shell.

    5.1 To use the log for monitoring, in a separate Terminal window, from the Alation shell, tail the ``reconcile_flag.log`` file. When the script run is completed, you should see a message that the flags have been reconciled and the number of flags. Execution errors, should any occur,  will be printed to the log too. Contact Alation Support if the script execution ends in an error.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        tail -f /opt/alation/django/alation_analytics_v2/one_off_scripts/reconcile_flag.log

    5.2 To check if the process is still active, in a Terminal window connected to the Alation host, outside of the Alation shell, use the command below to list the current processes and check if there is a process with the corresponding PID.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        ps -a

6. After completing the flags script, in a similar way, run the script to reconcile tags. The script should also be run from the directory **/opt/alation/django/alation_analytics_v2/one_off_scripts/** in the Alation shell and as user ``alation``.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        nohup python -u reconcile_tags.pyc >> reconcile_tags.log &

7. This command will launch a process with a PID. Save the PID value as you may need it. You can monitor this process by either tailing the corresponding log inside of the Alation shell or checking on the corresponding PID outside of the Alation shell.

    7.1 To use the log for monitoring, in a separate Terminal window, from the Alation shell, tail the ``reconcile_tags.log`` file. When the script run is completed, you should see a message that the tags have been reconciled and the number of tags. Execution errors, should any occur,  will be printed to the log too. Contact Alation Support if the script execution ends in an error.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        tail -f /opt/alation/django/alation_analytics_v2/one_off_scripts/reconcile_tags.log

    7.2 To check if the process is still active, in a Terminal window connected to the Alation host, outside of the Alation shell, use the command below to list the current processes and check if there is a process with the corresponding PID.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        ps -a

8. After completing the scripts, to exit from the user ``alation``, use the ``exit`` command.

.. important::

    Depending on whether or not you have to perform other post-upgrade actions, consider taking a second full backup after running these scripts.

    If none of the next steps apply to your instance, we recommend creating a second backup after running the Alation Analytics scripts. If your instance is large and this requirement is not feasible, you can plan to take the next backup on your schedule. However, if there is a need to restore from a backup that was taken before applying the scripts, you'll need to run the scripts again on the restored instance.

    If you have more scripts to run after the update, consider taking a second full backup after running all the scripts.
