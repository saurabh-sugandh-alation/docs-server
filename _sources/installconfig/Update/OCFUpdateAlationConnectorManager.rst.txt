Update Alation Connector Manager
======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from release 2021.1*

After updating your Alation instance to a newer release, use these steps to update Alation Connector Manager. This instruction applies when Alation Connector Manager and OCF connectors are installed on the same host with the Alation application.

.. note::

    Alation Connector Manager only needs to be updated when an Alation release or a patch release includes changes that affected it. This is usually called out in the update instructions for a specific release.

        To update Alation Connector Manager:

          1. On the Alation host, outside of the Alation shell, stop Alation Connector Manager (ACM).

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo service hydra stop

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                      - On any operating system except Oracle Linux 7, use this command:

                          .. code-block:: Bash

                              systemctl stop --user hydra

                      - On Oracle Linux 7 only, use this command:

                          .. code-block:: Bash

                              hydra stop


          2. Make sure that the corresponding container is stopped.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo docker ps --filter name=agent

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        docker ps --filter name=agent

          3. Stop Docker.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo systemctl stop docker

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    - On any operating system except Oracle Linux 7, use this command:

                        .. code-block:: Bash

                            systemctl stop --user hydra

                    - On Oracle Linux 7, skip this step. For Oracle Linux 7, Docker in rootless mode is managed entirely by ACM itself.


          4. Determine the new available version of Alation Container Service.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    ls /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/alation_container_service

          5. Update the Alation Container Service. In the command below, substitute the placeholder value ``<version_number>`` with the version number you found out.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo yum upgrade -y /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/alation_container_service/alation-container-service-<version_number>-1.x86_64.rpm


          6. Copy and paste the script below into the console and run it. The script will update the ``alation-hydra`` package on the host. Respond to the prompt in the console to confirm the update.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    if sudo yum list install hydra &> /dev/null; then
                    sudo yum install /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/hydra.rpm
                    else
                    sudo yum update /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/hydra.rpm
                    fi

          7. Start Docker.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo systemctl start docker

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    - On any operating system except Oracle Linux 7, use these command:

                        .. code-block:: Bash

                            systemctl start --user docker

                    - On Oracle Linux 7 only, skip this step.


          8. Start ACM.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo service hydra start

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    - On any operating system except Oracle Linux 7, use this command:

                        .. code-block:: Bash

                            systemctl start --user docker

                    - On Oracle Linux 7 only, use this command:

                        .. code-block:: Bash

                            hydra start


          9. Confirm that the ``agent`` and connector containers are running by listing the containers.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo docker ps

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        docker ps

          10. Enter the Alation shell.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

          11. Change the user to ``alation``.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo su alation

          12. Verify that the Django OCF Connector service ``ypireti`` can reach ACM.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    alation_ypireti list --fields id name hydra

                The output will confirm connection to ACM at the configured port and print the current OCF connector metadata if any OCF connectors are installed.

          13. Exit from the user and the Alation shell by using ``exit`` two times.


    .. tab:: Ubuntu and Debian

          To update Alation Connector Manager:

          1. On the Alation host, outside of the Alation shell, stop Alation Connector Manager (ACM):

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo service hydra stop

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        systemctl stop --user hydra

          2. Make sure that the corresponding container is stopped.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo docker ps --filter name=agent

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        docker ps --filter name=agent

          3. Stop Docker.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo systemctl stop docker

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        systemctl stop --user docker


          4. Determine the new available version of Alation Container Service.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    ls /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/alation_container_service

          5. Update the Alation Container Service. In the command below, substitute the placeholder value ``<version_number>`` with the version number you found out.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo apt update

                    sudo apt install -y /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/alation_container_service/alation-container-service_<version_number>_amd64.deb


          5. Update ACM. Run the command given below to begin the update.

                .. note::

                    In 2021.1 the ``hydra`` package was renamed from to ``alation-hydra`` to avoid conflicts with third-party software. The ``apt`` package manager automatically resolves the name and selects the correct package to update.

                - **Version 2022.2 and newer**: substitute ``x.x.x-xxx`` in the package name with the actual version you find in **/opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/**.

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo apt install /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/hydra-x.x.x-xxx.deb

                - **Versions before 2022.2**

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo apt install /opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/hydra.deb

          6. You will be prompted on whether or not you want to overwrite your current configuration and freshly install the new package. The answer is ``N`` (No). This is also the default. Keep your current configuration and update the existing package. The prompt will be similar to the following example:

                    .. image:: ../../_static/UpdateOCFHydra_01.png

          7. Start Docker.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo systemctl start docker

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        systemctl start --user docker

          8. Start Alation Connector Manager.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo service hydra start

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        systemctl start --user hydra

          9. Confirm that the ``agent`` and connector containers are running by listing the containers with the command below.

                - REGULAR DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        sudo docker ps

                - ROOTLESS DOCKER

                    .. code-block:: Bash

                        docker ps

          10. Enter the Alation shell.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

          11. Change user to ``alation``.

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    sudo su alation

          12. Verify that the Django OCF Connector service ``ypireti`` can reach ACM:

                .. code-block:: Bash

                    alation_ypireti list --fields id name hydra

                The command output will confirm connection to ACM at the configured port and print the current OCF connector metadata if any OCF connectors are installed:

                .. image:: ../../_static/UpdateOCFHydra_03.png

          13. Exit from the user and the Alation shell by using ``exit`` two times.


Check Version of Alation Connector Manager
-------------------------------------------------

To find out the version of Alation Connector Manager that is installed on the Alation host:

1. Use SSH to connect to the Alation host.
2. On the host, outside of the Alation shell, check the version with this command:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo hydra version

The output will look similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: Bash

          [ssh-user@ip-172-31-27-47]$ sudo hydra version

          Hydra version 1.2.0-766, by Alation

Check Alation Connector Manager Package Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From **version 2022.2**, you can find the version number in the name of the Alation Connector Manager package in **/opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra** (ouside of the Alation shell), for example: **/opt/alation/alation/opt/addons/hydra/hydra-1.2.0-766.rpm**.

    .. note::

        This directory also contains symlinks ``hydra.deb`` and ``hydra.rpm``, which is expected.

In versions before 2022.2, the package version is not present in the package name.
