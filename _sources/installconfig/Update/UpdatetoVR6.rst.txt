Update Alation to V R6 (5.10.x)
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

The process of updating Alation to V R6 (5.10.x) from an older release
depends on your current release number.

If you want to update from versions:

-  V R2 (5.4.x)
-  V R3 (5.6.x)
-  V R4 (5.8.x)
-  V R5 (5.9.x)

then first refer to `Updating from V R2, V R3, V R4, V R5`_.

If you want to update from versions before V R2 (5.4.x), and namely:

-  4.8.x
-  V R1 (5.0.x)

Read the information in `Updating from Before V R2`_.

Updating from V R2, V R3, V R4, V R5
------------------------------------

-  `V R5 To V R6`_
-  `V R2, V R3, VR4  To V R6`_
-   After you have updated Alation to V R6, you can also :doc:`upgrade the Alation internal PostgreSQL instances <../../installconfig/Update/UpgradeInternalPostgreSQLInstances>` to PostgreSQL version 9.6.

V R5 To V R6
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update from V R5 (5.9.x) to V R6 (5.10.x) follows the `Regular Update Scenario`_.

also see `PostgreSQL Upgrade to 9.6`_  .

V R2, V R3, VR4  To V R6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In *V R6 (5.10.x)*, Alation no longer includes the MongoDB component. In a
regular scenario, migration off Mongo DB has already been completed in
the background on your instance, and you can update to R6 following
the `Regular Update Scenario`_.

If the V R6 updater quits with the following error:

`The installer will abort until migration job from MongoDB to Postgres
has succeeded` -

then follow `Irregular Scenario: MongoDB Migration is Not Complete`_.

also see `PostgreSQL Upgrade to 9.6`_. You can upgrade
PostgreSQL on a separate schedule after you have updated Alation to V
R6.

If you are updating from V R4 and earlier, see `Scheduled Query Migration: V R6 Changes`_

Regular Update Scenario
------------------------

Plan your update from V R2, V R3, V R4, and V R5 using the following information:

- General Alation update information: :doc:`Update Alation <../../installconfig/Update/index>`

- Important :doc:`Update Safety Best Practice <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateSafetyBestPractice>`

- Update instructions for your instance type:

      -  :doc:`Manual Software Update - Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`
      -  :doc:`Update on HA Pair (4.7 and Above) <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`

- PostgreSQL upgrade from 9.3 to 9.6: :doc:`Upgrade Internal PostgreSQL Instances </installconfig/Update/UpgradeInternalPostgreSQLInstances>`.

Irregular Scenario: MongoDB Migration is Not Complete
-----------------------------------------------------

Incomplete off-Mongo DB migration causes the following error during the attempted update to V R6:

`The installer will abort until migration job from MongoDB to Postgres
has succeeded.`

Updating from Before V R2
--------------------------

If your current release is 4.8.x or V R1 (5.0.x), then updating to V R6 will have to be achieved in three steps.

Step 1: Update to V R4 (latest patch version)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to update to:

-  V R4 (latest available patch version)

.. note::

   In your Alation version, one of the internal components is *MongoDB* .  It is used for storing Alation server data, such
   as, for example, the results of Compose queries.
   Starting with version V R2 (5.4.x), Alation began to migrate the
   server data off MongoDB to a PostgreSQL database. This transition has
   been happening in the background and is complete in *V R5
   (5.9.x)* where the MongoDB component is no longer present in the
   Alation package.

   This transition is a major architectural change in the Alation
   application, and, unfortunately, it does not allow us to support a
   seamless update from your version to V R6.

   The intermediary stage is updating to V R4 (latest available patch),
   which is required for Alation to start and complete the transition
   from MongoDB to PostgreSQL as the internal server data repository.


Plan your update to V R4 using the following information in Help
Center:

- General Alation update information: :doc:`Update Alation <../../installconfig/Update/index>`

- Important :doc:`Update Safety Best Practice <../../installconfig/Update/UpdateSafetyBestPractice>`

- :doc:`Release Specific Update Pre-checks <../../installconfig/Update/ReleaseUpdatePrechecks>` : this instruction ``does`` apply to your Alation instance, perform those checks to prepare for the update.

- The update instructions for your instance type:

      -  :doc:`Manual Software Update - Standalone Systems <../../installconfig/Update/ManualSWUpdate>`
      -  :doc:`Update on HA Pair (4.7 and Above) <../../installconfig/Update/updateHAPair>`

When you successfully update Alation to V R4, you can move to the next
step.

Step 2: Allow Time For MongoDB Transition to Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let your updated R4 instance run over at least one weekend. In the
background, Alation will start and complete the server data migration
off MongoDB to PostgreSQL.

After the migration is complete, you can go to the next stage and update
to V R6.

.. note::

   On a Saturday after the update, Alation will automatically trigger the MongoDB migration script that copies the Alation server data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. In a regular scenario, this migration should be completed over one weekend. If it requires a longer time, the process will be working until the migration is finished successfully.

   You can check *mongo-data-migration.log* at **/opt/alation/site/logs** after the weekend to make sure that migration is complete.

Step 3:Update to V R6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plan your update to V R6 using the information in Help Center and
then update your instance: `Regular Update Scenario`_.

.. note::

    You might see the following message:

    *The installer will abort until migration job from MongoDB to Postgres has succeeded.*

    This means the data migration may have completed with errors.
    assistance.

PostgreSQL Upgrade to 9.6
-------------------------

*Applies to instances UPDATED to V R6 from prior releases*

*Does not apply to new installations of V R6*

After you have updated Alation to V R6 you can choose to upgrade its
internal PostgreSQL databases to version 9.6. This PostgreSQL upgrade
can be done on a schedule independent from updating the Alation
application.

.. note::

   Releases before V R6 use PostgreSQL 9.3.
   PostreSQL 9.3 is at end of life and no longer receives updates or bug
   fixes.

We recommend that you upgrade to PostgreSQL 9.6. Alation will stop using
the PostgreSQL 9.3 in one of the releases that will follow V R6, and
upgrading PostgreSQL to 9.6 will become a requirement.

See :doc:`Upgrade Internal PostgreSQL Instances <../../installconfig/Update/UpgradeInternalPostgreSQLInstances>` for steps.

Scheduled Query Migration: V R6 Changes
---------------------------------------

There are some important changes to the behavior of scheduled queries in
V R6 compared to previous releases. Be prepared for the
following:

R4 and earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have UNPUBLISHED SCHEDULED queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In R6, you can no longer schedule unpublished queries.

During update to V R6, your UNPUBLISHED SCHEDULED queries will be
automatically PUBLISHED to keep your query schedule. You will
receive an email notification informing you about this change and
having the list of auto-published queries.

Note that this auto-publishing will create a major version in the query
version history.

If you have PUBLISHED SCHEDULED queries that include changes you haven’t published yet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In R6, only the published part of the query can run on schedule. During
update to V R6, such queries will be automatically republished in full
so that there are no unpublished edits in these queries. You will
receive an email notification informing you about this change and
having the list of auto-republished queries.

Note that auto-republishing will create a major version in the query
version history.
