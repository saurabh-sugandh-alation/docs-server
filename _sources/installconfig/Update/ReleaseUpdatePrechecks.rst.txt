Release-specific Update Pre-checks
=====================================================================

Updating Alation from versions between

-  *4.8.x* and *V R1 (5.0.x)*

to higher versions through V R4 (5.8.x)

Use this instruction to check for update readiness if you are going to
update from a version between 4.8.x or V R1 (5.0.x) to V R2 (5.6.x) or
higher. Do the following pre-checks:

#. `Step 1. Licensing`_
#. `Step 2. MongoDB Size Check`_
#. `Step 3. Custom Drivers Check`_
#. `Step 4. Kerberos Configuration Check`_
#. `Step 5. Hive with Kerberos over SSL Check`_
#. `Step 6. Non-Default Hive Driver (1.1.1 or 2.1.0) Check`_

Step 1. Licensing
------------------------------------------------------

Versions 4.10.x and above require a valid license to be placed on
the filesystem to update.

#. Obtain your license file from `Customer Portal <https://customerportal.alationdata.com/>`_.
#. Put the license file ``alation_license.lic`` on your Alation server at ``/opt/alation/alation_license.lic``. Note that this location is outside of Alation chroot.
#. Follow the appropriate update instructions.

Step 2. MongoDB Size Check
------------------------------------------------------

Before updating, you must provide sufficient free disk space. We
recommend providing at least twice the current size of MongoDB on the
disk. In product versions before V R2 (5.4.x), "MongoDB" is the internal part of
Alation for collecting backend server data.

The updater will automatically exit early with a warning if you do not
have the required free disk space available.

.. note::

   This disk space requirement exists because in VR2 the Alation server is migrating off MongoDB. Starting from V R2, the data stored in MongoDB will be gradually copied over to a PostgreSQL database. In a future release, MongoDB will be completely removed. Until this removal is complete, extra space is required for both copies of the data.

How to validate you have enough disk space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to your data drive (usually at ``/data`` ) and run the following command to see how much disk space is used by MongoDB:

   .. code-block:: Bash

       du -k --max-depth=0 -h ./mongo

2. Double this number: it is the free space needed for
   updating.
3. Check how much free space exists. On the host, outside the Alation
   chroot, run:

   .. code-block:: Bash

       df -h

The output will show the used and available disk space for the
disks. Find the main data disk. It is usually called ``/data`` .
Find the number in the **Avail** column: this should be more than
the space needed that you have calculated in Step 2.

Updater quits with Install Aborted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If updater quits with the **Install Aborted** error, you can either:

-  Free the required disk space and try the update again.
-  Follow the instructions in the update warning to ignore the disk
   space check. The updater checks for at least two times the size of
   MongoDB of free disk space, which is conservative. You can
   proceed with less, but we recommend you monitor the disk space for a
   few weeks after the update.

Step 3. Custom Drivers Check
------------------------------------------------------

After updating your staging server, you will need to verify that
your custom drivers work in VR2 (or higher version).

How to know if you used a custom driver? Before updating, check if you have used any custom drivers.

In versions below V R2, it was possible to use custom drivers by placing
them in the Alation backend server to connect to some
databases. You can check if you have ever placed a driver into the
backend by running the following command from inside the Alation
chroot :

.. code-block:: Bash

    ls /opt/alation/site/site_data/pre_added_jars/

If this directory is empty you can skip this section.

If not, and you find files there, it is possible that you are using
custom drivers in your instance. In Alation, find the Data Sources which
use these custom drivers and use the steps below to continue using them
after the update. The custom drivers will have to be relocated to a
different directory after the update.

To continue using custom drivers after updating Alation,

#. Update your staging server.
#. Copy the custom drivers you located in   ``/pre_added_jars`` to a new location inside the chroot: ``/opt/alation/site/site_data/custom_drivers/​``.
#. Restart the Taskserver and Connector:

   .. code-block:: Bash

       alation_supervisor restart java:taskserver
       alation_supervisor restart java:connector

4. In Alation, for the Data Sources which should use these custom
   drivers, select the correct driver on the**Network Connection** > **Data Source Settings** >
   **General Settings** tab. Confirm that
   the network connection works and run metadata extraction, a Compose
   query and a table profile (if you use them).

   .. note::

        To open General Settings of a Data Source,

            #. In Alation, on the main toolbar, click **Sources** . The Sources page will open.
            #. Click **Manage Settings**, then click the name of your Data Source. The corresponding Data Source page will open.
            #. Alternatively, you can use left-hand navigation to find the Data Source you need.
            #. In the upper-right corner, click **More** then click **Settings** to open the Data Source settings page.
            #. Click **General Settings** tab to open it.

If the driver does not appear in UI after you relocated it, confirm you
have placed it in the correct folder as described above and restarted
the required processes.

Step 4. Kerberos Configuration Check
------------------------------------------------------

If you do not use any Data Sources with Kerberos authentication, you can
skip this section. Even if you do use Kerberos there is a good chance
everything will work, and you can skip this section. If you experience a
problem connecting to your Kerberos authenticated data source after the
update, refer to this section for details on how you may fix it.

Alation V R2 (and higher) uses a newer version of Java (Java 9) which
introduced a bug ​fix​ that causes the ``renew_lifetime`` parameter in
Kerberos configuration file ``/etc/krb5.conf`` to be respected. This
means that if this parameter had been previously improperly configured,
it would not have mattered because it was ignored. Now, after the update
to VR2 (or higher), the authentication using Kerberos may fail. This will
result in a "Message Stream Modified" error in Taskserver and Connector.

If you experience this problem after updating, we recommend you remove
the ``renew_lifetime`` parameter from the ``/etc/krb5.conf`` files.

To remove the parameter,

#. Enter the Alation Shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

         sudo service alation shell

2. Remove the ``renew_lifetime`` parameter from ``/etc/krb5.conf`` .
3. Run the following commands to apply the changes:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_action copy_krb5_conf
        alation_supervisor restart java:*

4. Connect to your Kerberos-authenticated databases from Alation to
   verify the connection works.

Step 5. Hive with Kerberos over SSL Check
------------------------------------------------------

If you do not use a Data Source with this configuration you can skip this section.

You will need to perform a few steps to continue using your Hive Data
Source that authenticates with Kerberos over SSL. Follow these
steps after upgrading.

#. Go to the **General Settings** page for your Data Source.
#. Under **Network Connection**, find the **Driver** dropdown menu.
#. Click **Driver**, and find and select a drive named ``com.alation.drivers.hive.Hive2Driver.com.alation.drivers.hive.one.1.1.1-1.1.1-kerberos-ssl-patched`` .
#. Test the **Service Account** section.
#. Test running a Compose query.
#. Test metadata extraction.

.. note::

   To open General Settings of a Data Source,

    #. In Alation, on the main toolbar, click **Sources** . The Sources
       page will open.
    #. Click **Manage Settings**, then click the name of your Data
       Source. The corresponding Data Source page will open.
    #. Alternatively, you can use left-hand navigation to find the Data
       Source you need.
    #. In the upper-right corner, click **More** then
       click **Settings** to open the Data Source settings page.
    #. Click **General Settings** tab to open it.

Step 6. Non-Default Hive Driver (1.1.1 or 2.1.0) Check
------------------------------------------------------

Read this section if you are using Hive Data Sources with custom drivers (not
provided by Alation). If you do not use any Hive Data Sources or
you are confident you have not changed the Hive driver version that
Alation uses by default, you can skip this section.

In your instance, you may have changed the default Hive driver version
by changing the parameter ``supervisor.shims.hive_version`` in ``alation_conf`` file.

Before updating, check the value of ``supervisor.shims.hive_version`` in ``alation_conf`` . If its
value is not ``0.14.0`` (default), but is ``1.1.1``, ``2.1.0``, or
other, you will need to take the following action after
updating:

#. In Alation, navigate to the **General Settings** tab of your Hive Data Source Settings page.
#. Under **Network Connections**, in the **Driver** list, find and select the appropriate driver that matches your current setting of ``supervisor.shims.hive_version`` .

Backup Reminder
-----------------

Alation runs backups automatically on a nightly basis; we strongly
recommend verifying that your backups are running correctly before
updating your system. The best way to validate a backup is to perform a
full restore on a separate system.

To follow an even safer update best practice, if your infrastructure
allows for the creation of a complete system snapshot/image, create one before installing the update. Make sure that the image
restore process is tested at least once on a test server. After a
successful update, you can delete this image.
