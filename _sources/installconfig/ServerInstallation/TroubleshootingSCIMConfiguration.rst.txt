Troubleshooting SCIM Configuration
======================================

*Applies from release 2021.3*

Logs
---------

SCIM-related API calls are logged at different logger levels (Debug, Info, and Error) in different files in **site/logs/** (path inside the Alation Chroot):

    - **scim-error.log**: Logs the unexpected exceptions
    - **scim-info.log**: SCIM configuration errors and exceptions, authentication errors, and received API requests.
    - **scim-debug.log**: application behaviors pertaining to user lifecycle and group lifecycle.


Checking the Configuration
----------------------------

View SCIM Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The currently set SCIM service account credentials can be viewed from the Alation Django shell. To view the service account credentials for SCIM:

1. On the Alation host, enter the Alation shell and then enter the Django shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo etc/init.d/alation shell
        alation_django_shell

2. From the Django shell, run the following code:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        from rosemeta.utils.users_and_groups.configuration_utils import get_scim_basic_auth_info

        get_scim_basic_auth_info()

This will print the credentials to the console.

View SCIM Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCIM configuration values are saved in **alation_conf**. To check the currently set values, you can use the **alation_conf** command and the corresponding parameter name: :doc:`Viewing SCIM Configuration in alation_conf <../../installconfig/ServerInstallation/ViewSCIMConfiguration>`.

.. _TroubleShooting_SCIM-Allow_Okta:

Allowing Okta IP Addresses
---------------------------------

Issue in Okta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Okta user interface, when testing the connection between Alation and Okta during SCIM configuration, the following error occurs:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        Error Authenticating: Null

Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Check the basic authentication username and password saved within Django.
2. Check the SCIM-related information in the SCIM application.
3. Check ``alation-debug.log`` for any authentication-specific errors.

If none of the above checks renders a solution, this may be a network issue. The SCIM protocol requires network access to the Alation instance in order to send user and group packages to the corresponding REST API endpoint. To allow Okta to reach Alation, you need to allow access from the Okta IP address range relevant to your region to the network hosting the Alation server. Refer to the following Okta documentation for more details:

    - `Okta IP address allow list <https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/ip-address-allow-listing.htm>`_.

Test the connection again after you have enabled network access from the Okta IP addresses.

.. _TroubleShooting_SCIM-Allow_Azure:

Allowing Azure AD IP Addresses
--------------------------------------

Issue in Azure AD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Azure portal interface, when testing the connection between Alation and the Azure application during SCIM configuration, the following error occurs:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        Error code: systemForCrossDomainIdentitiyManagementCredentialValidationUnavilable
        Details: We received this unexpected response from your application:
        Message: An error occurred while sending the request

Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check the basic authentication username and password saved within Django.
2. Check the SCIM-related information.
3. Check alation-debug.log for any authentication-specific errors.

If none of the above checks renders a solution, this may be a network issue:

    - The Alation server in your network does not allow traffic from Azure AD
    - Azure AD cannot resolve the DNS of the SCIM endpoint of the Alaiton server.

You need to ensure that the network policy in your network allows access from the Azure AD IP addresses for the Azure public cloud.

Find the Azure AD IP Range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Azure AD provisioning service currently operates using the IP ranges for Azure Active Directory as listed in `Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519&WT.mc_id=rss_alldownloads_all>`_.

    .. important::

        The IPs in this list change every week. Alation strongly recommends adding an automation to regularly refresh the IPs in the load balancer security group.

In the file you download from Azure, find the ``AzureActiveDirectory`` tag and the IPs listed under this tag. The screenshot below shows an example of the IP address range as can be seen in the file.

    .. image:: ../../_static/SCIM_sync_prereq.png


Add Azure IPs to the Security Group of the Load Balancer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To allow traffic from the Azure AD provisioning service to the Alation server on your network, add the Azure IP range for ``AzureActiveDirectory`` to the security group of the load balancer of the network that hosts the Alation server.

After the IPs are added the connection test should be successful.

If not, this could be a DNS issue. Azure should be able to resolve the REST API endpoint of the Alation instance used by SCIM. This endpoint follows this format: ``https://mycatalog.alationdata.com/scim/v2/``. Use the tips below to check if Azure AD can reach Alation.

Check if Azure AD Can Access Alation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run ``dig <alation server name>`` from the Azure AD network to check if it can access the Alation server.

The screenshot below shows the output when we are not able to get an IP for the DNS name.

    .. image:: ../../_static/SCIM_sync_prereq2.png

If you get a similar output, this may be due to the fact that the server can only be accessed through the internal VPN. Compare the output that shows that the DNS is successfully resolved and that returns IP addresses:

    .. image:: ../../_static/SCIM_sync_prereq3.png

The solution will be specific to your network configuration. You can also contact Alation Support to help find a solution.

Error Messages
-----------------

Alation follows exception handling as prescribed in the `SCIM specification <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.12>`_ that defines exception types. Use the table below to interpret exceptions found in the logs.
