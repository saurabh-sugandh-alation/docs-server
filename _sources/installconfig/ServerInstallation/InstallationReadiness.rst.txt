Installation Readiness
======================

Setup
-----

-  Confirm `Customer Portal <https://customerportal.alationdata.com>`_ access
-  Download build and transfer to system
-  Download the license file

System
------

-  Verify Root access
-  Verify whether global users exist in the domain.  PostgreSQL is the
   most frequently found conflict.  If any Linux user already exists in
   the domain, pre-create the conflicting users.  Check using the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      id postgres

-  CPU: Check the number of cores

   .. code-block:: bash

      grep -i processor /proc/cpuinfo

-  CPU: Check the architecture (64/32-bit)

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo lscpu | grep -E Architecture

-  CPU: Check the CPU MHz

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo lscpu | grep -E "CPU|Hz"

-  RAM: Check the RAM size

   .. code-block:: bash

      free -g

-  Disks and File Systems

   -  Root filesystem

      -  Verify enough space to install under **/opt**

         .. code-block:: bash

            df -hT /opt

   -  Data and Backup Disks:

      -  Check that data and backup disks are mounted,
      -  check sizes, verify enough space to backup (backup >= data size)

         .. code-block:: bash

            df -hT
            mount -l

   -  Check mount settings in **/etc/fstab**

      -  Verify data and backup mounts are entered
      -  Verify nosuid and noexec option are not used

         .. code-block:: bash

            cat /etc/fstab | grep nosuid

         -  Edit **/etc/fstab** to remove **nosuid** if found.

            .. code-block:: bash

               cat /etc/fstab | grep noexec

         -  Edit ``/etc/fstab`` to remove ``noexec`` if found.

-  Check OS version

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat /etc/centos-release

   (or)

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat /etc/os-release

-  DNS

   -  Confirm that Alation has access to the DNS

-  Authentication Mechanism

   -  Confirm port 80 is open

-  Email

   -  Confirm ports are open
   -  Confirm connectivity to corp email server (``telnet`` or ``dig`` can be used)

-  Confirm Unix users are created, if necessitated by environment
   requirements

   -  Check ``/etc/passwd``, ``/etc/group``

-  LDAP/LDAPS

   -  Confirm access to server on port **389/636**
   -  Confirm LDAP credentials and setup

-  Usage Stats

   -  Confirm connectivity to outbound TCP connection to **IP 52.4.59.229** port **443**

Connectivity
------------

Verify that the new system can access the data sources, (per ports listed for each Data Source type.

1. Verify connectivity over ports listed in the Network Requirements section. Use the following command to check the functioning of ports:

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -v telnet://<IP>:<PORT>

    .. note::

        You can alternatively use the **nc** command if it is installed on the host:

            .. code-block:: bash

                nc -zv <IP> <PORT>

        For UDP ports:

            .. code-block:: bash

                nc -zv <IP> <PORT>-u

        In cloud environments, the LDAP ports get closed. A quick way to check multiple ports at one time is by adding space between ports:

            .. code-block:: bash

                nc -zv 127.0.0.1 22 80 8080

2. Use the following command to return all services and the ports they are listening on:

    .. code-block:: bash

        netstat -plnt

3. Confirm handling of usage stats.

Data Source Checks
------------------

For each data source:

-  Verify connectivity from Alation system to data source
-  Verify authentication type
-  Confirm service account uses the same authentication type as users
-  Verify service account creation with appropriate permissions to run
   MDE, Profiling (if desired), and QLI
-  Verify that the Query Log Ingestion setup is completed


BI and Other Tool Checks
------------------------

-  Verify connectivity from Alation system to source
-  Confirm service account setup
