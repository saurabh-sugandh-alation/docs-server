User Authentication with LDAP
=============================

LDAP/AD integration can be performed using the Alation UI after the installation. You need the Server Admin role to set up LDAP/AD authentication.

Authentication with LDAP/AD allows users to log in to Alation with their existing corporate credentials. Note that for users logging with their LDAP accounts, Alation does not store the passwords.

If LDAP/AD group sync is enabled, changes to the corporate directory are automatically reflected in Alation 15 minutes after the change (default time). This time is needed for the Alation server to synchronize with the LDAP server.

Prerequisites
--------------

#. Confirm that the necessary ports are open in your network:

    =================== ======================== =============== ==================
    Service             Direction                Port            Destination
    =================== ======================== =============== ==================
    LDAP                Outbound (from Alation)  TCP 389         AD/LDAP server
    LDAPS               Outbound (from Alation)  TCP 636         AD/LDAP server
    =================== ======================== =============== ==================

2. Confirm that Alation has a service account to connect to the LDAP/AD server.
3. If your corporate network uses LDAPS, confirm that the required manual pre-configuration is performed on the Alation server. For details, see `LDAPS Configuration`_.
4. Prepare the following information:

    -  LDAP Hostname
    -  Protocol (LDAP or LDAPS)
    -  Base Distinguished Name (Base DN)
    -  Bind Distinguished Name (Bind DN) and password if your AD does not support anonymous bind. The bind account should have privileges to list and read attributes for First Name, Last Name, user ID, Email, Title, and Thumbnail Photo.
    -  User ID attribute name (for AD it is sAMAccountName)
    -  Email address attribute name (required)
    -  Title (optional)
    -  Thumbnail Photo (optional)

5. Optionally, you can use LDAP search filters to restrict access to a subset of users. Below are a few examples of filter expressions:

    -  Custom LDAP Search filter to restrict access to a subset of users. Below are some sample filter expressions:
    -  Check for membership in an AD group - *Finance*:

      ``(memberOf=cn=Finance,cn=Groups,dc=alation,dc=com)``

    -  Check for membership in AD groups *Finance* or *Sales*:

      ``((memberOf=cn=Finance,cn=Groups,dc=alation,dc=com)(memberOf=cn=Sales,cn=Groups,dc=alation,dc=com))``

    -  Check for nested membership in an AD ancestor group - *Europe*:

      ``(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=Finance,cn=Groups,dc=alation,dc=com)``

.. note::

    You can use the following symbols:

        - the pipe **|** for **OR**
        - the ampersand **&** for **AND**
        - the asterisk **\*** for a wildcard
        - the exclamation mark **!** for **NOT**


LDAPS Configuration
----------------------

This configuration must be performed before setting up LDAP authentication in Alation UI, if your companyâ€™s corporate network uses LDAP over SSL (LDAPS).
To authenticate with LDAPS when certificate validation is not ignored, you need to add your LDAPS CA certificate information to the file **/data1/site_data/ldap.conf**  (accessed from in Alation shell).

To configure LDAPS,

#. Access the file using the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo service alation shell
        cd /data1/site_data
        sudo vi ldap.conf

2. Enter the following certificate information into the file and save:

    -  To ignore certificate validation, provide the following values:

          .. code-block:: bash

              HOST <LDAP_HOSTNAME>
              PORT <LDAP_PORT>
              TLS_REQCERT allow

    -  To validate the SSL certificate, import your LDAPS CA certificate into ``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`` and in the ldap.conf file provide the following configuration values:

          .. code-block:: bash

              HOST <LDAP_HOSTNAME>
              PORT <LDAP_PORT>
              TLS_CACERT /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
              TLS_REQCERT demand

    .. note::

        Client side certificate validation is not supported yet.

3. Deploy the configuration as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_action copy_ldap_conf
        alation_action deploy_conf_ldap
        alation_action stop_uwsgi
        alation_action start_uwsgi

Configure LDAP/LDAPS in Admin Settings
---------------------------------------
To configure LDAP/LDAPS,

#. Sign in to Alation as a **Server Admin** and in the upper-right corner, click the **Settings**  icon to open the **Admin Settings** page.

#. In the Server Admin section, click **Authentication** to open the Authentication tab:

  .. image:: /_static/install_image2.png
    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

3. In the LDAP Settings section, provide the following values:

4. Click Save to save the LDAP properties you have entered.
5. Under **Test Login and Save**, enter a userâ€™s LDAP/AD credentials and click **Test** to test-search and validate the correctness of your LDAP settings. Note that the credentials you use for testing are not saved in Alation. For possible errors, check and update the parameters you have entered and test again. For troubleshooting tips, refer to `Debugging LDAP configuration issues with ldapsearch command`_.
6. If your test is successful, in the **Authentication Method** list on top of the Authentication tab (above the LDAP Settings section where you entered the LDAP parameters) select **LDAP** and click **Save** to switch to LDAP authentication in your Alation instance.

Users will now be able to log in to Alation with their corporate LDAP/AD credentials. Their Alation accounts will be created at the time of their first login with the with the default role set in Alation. These accounts will not store corporate passwords.

.. note::

   Alation recommends keeping one or more built-in accounts available for troubleshooting purposes.


Debugging LDAP configuration issues with ldapsearch command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ldapsearch`` command is available in the Alation shell. Â If desired,
this command line tool can be used for debugging.

Replace all the highlighted elements in the command below with
the appropriate values. Enter the password for Bind DN when prompted. If
this command does not work, Alation LDAP integration will not work
either.

   ::

      ldapsearch -x -W -H "PROTOCOL://HOSTNAME" -D "BIND DN" -b "BASE DN" "(cn=username)"

Potential issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  -  If you get the invalid credentials error, check your Bind DN and Bind account password.
  -  If you do not get any results, double-check the User ID, Base DN, or Group Filter.

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Search for a user ID "sparker" on the Active Directory using a Bind
   account **calledcn=alation-svc,cn=Users,dc=mycompany,dc=com**

   ::

      ldapsearch -x -W -H "ldap://myad.mycompany.com" -D "cn=alation-svc,cn=Users,dc=mycompany,dc=com" -b "dc=mycompany,dc=com" "(sAMAccountName=sparker)"

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Search for a user ID "sparker"Â in a group
   **calledcn=alation-users,cn=Groups,dc=mycompany,dc=com**Â on the Active
   Directory using a Bind account
   **calledcn=alation-svc,cn=Users,dc=mycompany,dc=com**

   ::

      ldapsearch -x -W -H "ldap://myad.mycompany.com" -D "cn=alation-svc,cn=Users,dc=mycompany,dc=com" -b "dc=mycompany,dc=com" "(&(sAMAccountName=sparker)(cn=alation-users,cn=Groups,dc=mycompany,dc=com))"
