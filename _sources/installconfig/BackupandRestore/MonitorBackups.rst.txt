Monitor Backups
==========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. note::

    The information in this section applies to **Backup V2**. Refer to :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/BackupV1AndV2/CheckCurrentBackupTool` for information on how to check your current backup framework.

Backup Log Location
---------------------

A single log file is created per day and log rotation happens every 5 days (default).

Version 2021.3.x and Newer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Backup V2 log file ``alation_backup.log`` is located at **/opt/alation/site/logs/** (path inside the Alation shell).

Versions 2020.3.x - 2021.2.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Backup V2 log file ``alation_backup.log`` is located at **/var/log/** (path inside the Alation shell).


Backup Health Check
--------------------------

For Server Admins to recieve alerts about backup failure, enable Health Check monitoring on your instance. See :doc:`Configuring Server Health Alerts for Administrators <../../admins/Troubleshooting/ConfigureServerHealthAlertsforAdmins>`. An alert on the backup health is one of the admin alerts that can be enabled.

.. note::

    If incremental backup fails, the staging files in **/pgbackup** should be cleared manually before performing the next backup.

Backup Status API
----------------------------

You can use the read-only Backup Status API to check the backup status. To call the API, use the following URLs:

- The latest backup process: **<your_alation_URL>/monitor/backup_status/**
- Last 10 backups: **<your_alation_URL>/monitor/backup_status/all**.
