Restore from a Backup
==================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

The steps to restore Alation from a backup depend on your Alation version and on whether or not you are managing the Postgres database backups separately.

		.. note::

		 		The restoration steps apply to all Alation releases and both backup frameworksâ€”Backup V1 and V2.

If Postgres backups are included into Alation backups (default), refer to :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/RestoreFromBackup/RestoreAlation`.

If you have excluded Postgres backups from Alation backups, refer to :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/RestoreFromBackup/RestoreAlationWithSeparatePostgresBackup` (available from version 2023.1).

The Alation backup restoration process only restores the Alation application. The Alation Analytics application and the OCF components require additional effort to be restored. For more information, refer to:

    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/RestoreFromBackup/RestoreAlationAnalytics`
    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/RestoreFromBackup/RestoreOCFComponents`
