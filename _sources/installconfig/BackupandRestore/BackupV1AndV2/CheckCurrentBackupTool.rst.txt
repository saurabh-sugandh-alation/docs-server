Check Current Backup Tool
================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies to versions 2020.3-2022.1*

In order to determine which backup tool is currently in use on the Alation server, check the value of the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation.backup_v2.enabled``. If it is set to ``False``, Alation uses Backup V1. If it is set to ``True``, Alation uses Backup V2.

    .. important::

        Do not change the parameter ``alation.backup_v2.enabled`` manually as it will result in an incomplete transition between backup tools and an inconsistent state of the system. To disable or enable Backup V2, use the steps described in :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/BackupV1AndV2/EnableOrDisableBackupV2`.

To check the value:

1. Use SSH to connect to your Alation instance.

2. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

3. Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_conf alation.backup_v2.enabled

This will output the current value of the parameter.

To exit the shell, type ``exit`` and press Enter.
