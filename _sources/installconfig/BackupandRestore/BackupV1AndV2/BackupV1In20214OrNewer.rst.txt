Backup V1 in Versions 2021.4 or Newer
==============================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

From version 2021.4, the Alation backup process backs up the Event Bus component of the Alation server. The Event Bus backups are not supported by Backup V1.

We do not recommend using Backup V1 starting in version 2021.4.

If you still opt to use Backup V1 in 2021.4, note that Backup V1 will not backup the Event Bus data. This means that if you enable Lineage V3 and Manual Lineage features while still using Backup V1, the data generated by these services will not be backed up, which will result in an inconsistent state of the lineage data in your backup.
