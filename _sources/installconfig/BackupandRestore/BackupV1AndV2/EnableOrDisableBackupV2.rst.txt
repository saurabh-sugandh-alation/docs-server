================================

*Applies to versions 2020.3 - 2021.1*

In **versions 2020.3 - 2021.1**, Backup V2 can be enabled on the backend of the Alation server, using the dedicated Alation action. This action will restart the Postgres service on your Alation instance, which will make Alation shortly unavailable for the time of the restart.

    .. important::

        From version 2021.2, Backup V2 is default. We do not recommend disabling it and returning to Backup V1 in 2021.2 or newer versions.


To enable Backup V2:

1. Use SSH to connect to your Alation instance.

2. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

3. Enable Backup V2 with the following action:

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_action enable_backupv2

    This action restarts the Postgres service on your Alation instance.

To disable Backup V2, run the disable action:

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_action disable_backupv2
