Backup V1 and Backup V2
=================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

Depending on your Alation version, the Alation server uses different backup frameworks, known as **Backup V1** and **Backup V2**:

    - **Versions prior to 2020.3** use a backup framework known as **Backup V1**.

    - **Version 2020.3** introduces a redesigned and improved backup framework—**Backup V2**. Backup V2 includes more features, such as incremental backups, the ability to manage Postgres backups separately from the Alation application backups, and improved backup validation and monitoring capabilities.

        .. note::

            In **versions from 2020.3 to 2021.1**, you can use either Backup V1 (default in these versions) or Backup V2. In these versions, Backup V2 can be enabled by an Alation Server Admin. See :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/BackupV1AndV2/EnableOrDisableBackupV2` for more details.

    - Starting in **version 2021.2**, Backup V2 is default. We do not recommend returning to Backup V1 in this and later versions.

Both Backup V2 and Backup V1 share these features:

    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/ConfigureBackups/DefineNumberOfBackupsToRetain`
    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/ConfigureBackups/OldBackupCleanup`

With Backup V2, you have access to the following capabilities:

    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/MonitorBackups`
    - :doc:`/installconfig/BackupandRestore/ManagePostgresBackupsSeparately`

Backup process depends on the backup framework you are using—Backup V1 or Backup V2— and your Alation release. For information on the backup process, refer to:
