Copy Backup Files to a Remote Location
=====================================================================

    This information applies to both Backup V1 and Backup V2.

Creation of a backup is a prerequisite for copying the backup file to a remote location. The execution of the script copies the backup files to a remote location. This requires admin access to the Alation host.

To copy the backup:

#. Create a script that copies the backup to the destination location. Ensure that it recognizes the ``%f`` variable that will be passed from Alation when the script is run. This variable passes the path to the backup.

    Example script:

    .. code-block:: bash

        FILE_TO_RSYNC=$1
        DESTINATION=host.example.com
        DESTINATION_PATH="/backup/alation/"
        SSH_USER="alation"
        SSH_KEY="/home/site_data/rsync_key.pem"
        rsync -avi -e "ssh -i ${SSH_KEY} -l ${SSH_USER}" "${FILE_TO_RSYNC}" "${DESTINATION}:${DESTINATION_PATH}" 

2. Place the script to **/data1/site_data** in the Alation shell.

   .. note::

      The backup scripts must be stored in **/data1/site_data**.
      This location prevents them from being deleted during an update.

3. Enable the script execution using **alation_conf**. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

4. Enable the script:

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_conf alation.backup.post_script.enabled -s True

5. Specify the path to the script, substituting the ``<backup_script_example.sh>`` with the actual file name. The input variable ``%f`` must be recognized by the script.

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_conf alation.backup.post_script.path -s "/data1/site_data/<backup_script_example.sh> %f"


6. Set the permission to execute the script.

    .. code-block:: bash

        chmod +x /data1/site_data/<backup_script_example.sh>

The script will run after every manual or automatic backup and copy the backup to the destination location.
