Find Backups

.. note::

    This information applies to both Backup V1 and Backup V2.

The default storage location for the backup files is **/data2/backup** inside the Alation shell. The default backup storage directory can be changed using the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation.backup.data_dump_dir``. At any time, the ``alation.backup.data_dump_dir`` parameter points to the location of the compressed backup files created by the backup process.

**On versions before 2021.4**, Alation creates one backup file—the Alation backup.

**Starting in version 2021.4**, Alation creates two backup files—the Alation backup and the Event Bus backup. Both backup files are required to restore the Alation application.
