Grant Access
---------------

For users to be able to view, query or manage the settings of the Alation Analytics V2 Data Source, they must be granted access.

1. As the Data Source Admin, find Alation Analytics V2 among the Data Sources. You can use search or the list on the Sources page to locate it.

2. Open the catalog page of Alation Analytics V2. Server Admins can first grant access to themselves, and then assign other users to be *Viewers*, *Queriers* or *Admins*.

3. To grant access to yourself as the Server Admin, in the upper-right corner of the Alation Analytics Data Source page, click **More** then click **Settings**. The **Edit Your Permissions to Access Settings** warning will pop up.

4. In this popup, click **Go to Access**. The Access tab of the Data Source settings page will open.

5. Find section **People**. In this section, click **Add** on the right, and in the Search Users list that opens, start typing your username. The list will update accordingly. Find and click your username to be added to the people with access list.

.. important::

    All new users are first added with the access level *Viewer*, including Server Admins. You can change the access level in the **Access Level** column of the People table.

To grant access to other users,

1. Click **Add** in the **People** section and then find and click the user to be added. The selected user will be added to the People list.

2. To change the access level for a user, find them in the People table, and click the current Access value in the **Access Level** column to open the list of options.

3. In the **Access Level** list, click the access level you want to assign to the user:

    - **Data Source Admin** - can manage the Data Source settings, add other users as Data Source Admins, Viewers, or Queriers, and query the Data Source. Data Source Admins are given a database account to connect to Alation Analytics and can set up the password on their Account Settings page.
    - **Querier** - can both view the extracted metadata and query Alation Analytics in Compose. Queriers are given a database account, too, and can set up the password on their Account Settings page.
    - **Viewer** - can only view the extracted metadata of the Data Source. They are not given an account to query Alation Analytics.

4. Users who are granted the Querier or Data Source Admin access must create a password for their Alation Analytics account and connect to the source from Compose using this individual account.

Setting Up Database Account for Alation Analytics V2
-------------------------------------------------------

Users granted the Querier or Data Source Admin access to Alation Analytics V2 must complete the setup of their database access account to be able to query this database using Compose or other BI tools. When a user is assigned either the Data Source Admin or the Querier access, they will receive an email notification from Alation with a link to their Account Settings page where they can provide the password for Alation Analytics.

.. note::

    For email notifications to reach users, the Email Server in Alation should have been set up.

To set up the database account password,

1. Follow the link in the Data Source assignment email notification. Alternatively, in Alation, you can click the User icon in the upper right-hand corner of the main toolbar and in the list that opens, click **Account Settings**. The user’s Account Settings page will open.

2. Click the **DB Connections** tab.

3. Under **Alation Analytics Connection**, click **Create Password** on the right to create a new password or click **Change Password** if you are changing your existing password. Note that you need to have either a Data Source Admin or Querier access to see the Alation Analytics V2 connection:
