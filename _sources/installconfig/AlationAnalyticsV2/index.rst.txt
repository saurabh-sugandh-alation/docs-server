*Available from version 2020.3*

**Alation Analytics** is a PostgreSQL database that surfaces usage data from the internal application database (Rosemeta) into the Alation Catalog. It is intended for data analysts and stewards who drive data catalog adoption and usage analytics at their organizations. Data in the Alation Analytics database can tell the story of how users interact with the Catalog and reveal information on usage intensity and patterns.

**Alation Analytics Version 2** - **(V2)** - is the new redesigned version of the Alation Analytics solution that is available from release 2020.3. It is aimed at improving and simplifying the usage data research experience as well as at resolving some known performance issues of the first version of Alation Analytics.

There are a number of motivating factors behind this redesign. One is the reported complexity of Alation Analytics which was in the way of adoption by users. This has been addressed with a completely refurbished data model in Alation Analytics V2 that makes data largely comprehensible and easily accessible. In addition, ready-to-use visualizations of popular catalog adoption metrics have been added to the Catalog.

Another motivator is the need for scalability. Alation Analytics V2 implements an architecture that allows for the remote installation of the Alation Analytics database, with components installed in Docker containers.

.. important::

    For customers who have been using the first version of Alation Analytics (V1) in releases prior to 2020.3: it remains fully operational after the Alation Catalog is updated to 2020.3. However, if Alation Analytics V1 has already been enabled on the Alation instance, Alation Analytics V2 is not available by default. To try out V2, please see :doc:`Transition from Alation Analytics to Alation Analytics V2 <../../installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/TransitionV1ToV2>` for guidance on how to enable and maintain both versions.

    On completely new installations of 2020.3 and newer releases and for customers who have never enabled Alation Analytics prior to updating the Catalog to 2020.3, Alation Analytics V2 is the only available option.
