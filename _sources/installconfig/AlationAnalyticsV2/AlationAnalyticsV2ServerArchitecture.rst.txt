Alation Analytics V2 Server Architecture
==========================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from version 2020.3*

Alation Analytics is installed outside of the Alation Chroot. The installation directory is **/opt/alation-analytics**. Before installation, when you untar the Alation Analytics V2 package into this directory, this action adds a number of files and folders, including the folder **docker-images**. It contains the Docker images that will be used by the Alation Analytics V2 installer to create the Alation Analytics V2 server components:

- **rabbitmq** - image for the message broker RabbitMQ;
- **base-transform** - image for multiple Transform  services required to perform the ETL;
- **postgres** - image for the Alation Analytics V2 database (PostgreSQL).

.. note::

    Alation Analytics V2 is PostgreSQL version 9.6.


All Alation Analytics Server components are installed as Docker containers in the directory **/opt/alation-analytics** outside of the Alation Chroot.
