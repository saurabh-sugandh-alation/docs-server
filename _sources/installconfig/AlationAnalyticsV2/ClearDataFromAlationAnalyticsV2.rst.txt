*Applies from version 2020.3*

You can re-initialize the Alation Analytics V2 database if at any time the data becomes corrupted. This action wipes out all current data and returns the database to the initial state where the schema is empty.

This action can be performed when there are no ETL jobs in progress.

Check the ETL Status Before Clearing Data
------------------------------------------------

To check on the ETL status,

Use Alation Compose to run this query on Alation Analytics V2. The results will show the state of all Transform jobs for the latest ETL run:

  .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT job_name,
          CASE
            WHEN job_status = 1  THEN 'STARTED'
            WHEN job_status = 2  THEN 'SUCCESS'
            WHEN job_status = 3  THEN 'FAILURE'
            WHEN job_status = 4  THEN 'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'
          END as status
        FROM etl_job_event_log
        WHERE load_id  = (SELECT MAX(load_id) FROM etl_job_event_log)
        ORDER BY job_name;
