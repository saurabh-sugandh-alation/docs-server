Alation Analytics V2 Dashboard
===============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from version 2020.3*

After enabling the Alation Analytics V2 data source, admin users get access to the **Alation Analytics Dashboard** with out-of-the-box visualizations of the catalog usage at your organization.

For Source Admins, Catalog Admins, and Server Admins, the **Apps** menu on the main toolbar includes the **Alation Analytics** menu option (from release 2020.4).

    .. note::

        In version 2020.3, this menu option is named **Analytics**.

Users with the Steward, Composer, and Viewer roles do not have access to the Alation Analytics application.

View the Alation Analytics Dashboard
-----------------------------------------

To view the Alation Analytics Dashboard, click the **Analytics** or **Alation Analytics** icon in the **Apps** menu on top right.

.. note::

    The name of the dashboard differs depending on your release:

        - **Insights** (release 2020.3)
        - **Alation Analytics Dashboard** (from release 2020.4).

The report data on the Alation Analytics Dashboard will only be available if enough data has been loaded with the ETL process. If you don't see any results, try adjusting the **Date Range** filters. The longer the Alation Analytics application is in use, the more data becomes available for the dashboard over time.

Alation Analytics Reports
-------------------------------------------

The out-of-the-box reports on the Alation Analytics Dashboard are:

- **Unique Active Users** (*available from 2020.3*) — A bar chart that shows the number of unique users who have logged in by month, for the last six months.
- **Total Catalog Views** (*available from 2020.3*) — A stacked bar chart that shows the number of catalog views by object type by month, for the last six months.
- **Total Flags** (*available from 2020.3*) — A stacked bar chart that shows the sum of flags by flag type by month, for the last six months.
- **Compose Query Executions** (*available from 2020.3*) — A bar chart that shows the number of SQL statement executions by month, for the last six months.
- **Popular Articles** (*available from 2020.3*) — A bar chart that shows total and unique views for the top ten most popular articles based on the last six months of data. Ranking for articles is determined using all visits vs. unique visits. Links to the top ten articles appear under the chart.
- **Popular Queries** (*available from 2020.4*) — A bar chart that shows the top ten popular published queries based on the last six months of data. Popularity is determined by the number of times a query is executed by unique users.
- **Popular Tables** (*available from 2020.4*) — A bar chart that shows the top ten most popular tables based on the last six months of data. The report is based on the table Popularity field in Alation.

The reports are updated after every ETL if the relevant data has changed.

Custom Visualizations
-------------------------------------------

*Available from version 2021.2*

If a Server Admin has added custom visualizations from Tableau to the Alation Analytics Dashboard, they will appear on the **Custom** tab. To see the custom views, users will need to first log in to their Tableau Server from Alation. After successful authentication, the custom reports should become available for viewing.

On how to configure the **Custom** tab, see :doc:`Embed External Visualizations <../../installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/EmbedExternalVisualizations>`.

Copy the Alation Analytics Dashboard Query to Compose
-------------------------------------------------------------

Admin users who have access to the Alation Analytics V2 data source as *Viewers*, *Queriers*, or *Data Source Admins*, can view the SQL behind the Alation Analytics reports in Compose.

To view the query SQL in Compose, click the **Open New Query In Compose** button on the top right of a chart. This will copy the underlying query to a new Compose query tab. Note that this action does not allow modifying the report itself. It only copies the SQL to Compose as a cloned new query. The changes you may choose to make to this copy of the query do not affect the reports on the Alation Analytics Dashboard.

    .. note::

        The **Open New Query In Compose** button will only be available if you have access to the Alation Analytics V2 data source as Viewer, Querier, or Data Source Admin.

When you run an Alation Analytics Dashboard query in Compose as is, it returns the results in the JSON format. To view the results in the table format, remove the wrapper that encodes the results in JSON, verify the SQL code and then run the query. The wrapper is the first and the last lines of the copied query:

    .. code-block:: bash

        SELECT row_to_json(query) FROM (
          <query SQL>
          ) AS query;

------------------------------------------

On the Alation Analytics Dashboard, you can export the report visualization into the SVG, PNG, or CSV formats. To export, click the **Export** menu on the top right of the chart area and click the format you need. The file will be downloaded to your computer.
