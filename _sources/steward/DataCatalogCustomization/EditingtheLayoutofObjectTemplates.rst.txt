Editing Object Template Layout
======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from release V R6 (5.10.x) to release 2023.1.3*

.. note::

    To edit object templates in release 2023.1.4 and later, see :doc:`Edit Object Templates </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/EditingObjectTemplates>`.

It is possible to customize the layout of object templates in Alation by
rearranging built-in and custom fields added to these templates.

Starting with V R6 (5.10.x), you can customize the layout of components
on  **Table** and **Column** object templates.

V R7 (5.12.x) adds the same ability for the Data Source and Schema
object templates.

.. note::

   Starting with V R7, you can customize the layout of object templates of:

   - Data Source
   - Schema
   - Table
   - Column

You need a Catalog or Server Admin admin role to edit object templates.

Object Template Customization Overview
--------------------------------------

When you first open the default catalog page of a data object, data
source, schema, table, or column, in the freshly installed Alation catalog,
it only has default fields organized into two sections: a wider main
section and a narrower right-hand section:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_2.png

However, you can customize the number of fields and their layout by
customizing the underlying template.

Object Template Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A template always has such components as built-in fields. These
are the default fields that appear on the catalog page before any
customizations are applied. A page can also have custom fields
and groupings of custom fields, which are the components that admins can
create, add to, and remove from templates.

Unlike custom fields, built-in fields depend on the type of object and
cannot be added or removed from templates. However, for Data Source,
Schema, Table, and Column pages, you can change the arrangement of
built-in fields in each respective template section.

Finding the Object Templates in the Catalog
-------------------------------------------

To open the template of an Alation object type,

1. If you are a Catalog Admin, hover over the settings icon on the right of the main
toolbar:

.. image:: ../../_static/Screen_Shot_2018-10-16_at_2.17.18_PM.png

In the menu that opens, click **Customize Catalog**:

.. image:: ../../_static/Template2.png

If you are a Server Admin, click the settings icon to open the
Admin Settings page then under **Catalog Admin**, click **Customize Catalog**:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_3.png

2. Click the **Custom Templates** tab to open the list of templates in
your catalog then under **Data Object Templates**, find and click
the template that you want to edit. The **Table** and **Column** templates are the two object templates
which offer extended layout customization starting with V R6 (5.10.x).
Starting with V R7 (5.12.x), you can also apply extended
customization to the **Data Source** and **Schema** templates:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_4.png

3. The template editor page that opens represents the layout of the
associated catalog page: the fields and sections you see on the template
are displayed in the same order in which they will appear on the catalog
page. You can add, remove, and rearrange the template components.

Default Table Template:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_5.png

When working on your template, you can open a second browser tab with
the catalog page of a table or column, depending on which template you
are editing. After making and saving the changes to the template,
refresh the catalog page of the object to quickly see the
changes.

What Can be Modified?
---------------------

On the **Data Source**, **Schema**, **Table**, and **Column** object templates, you can:

-  Add custom fields and custom field groupings.
-  Give labels to the custom field groupings.
-  Move built-in and custom fields and custom field groupings up and down in sections and sometimes left and right between sections.

You cannot:

-  Remove built-in fields.
-  See **Related Topics** and back reference fields. They do not
   appear on the template and their position on the catalog page is
   fixed at the bottom of the right-hand section.

.. important::

   The list of custom fields available for adding to the template does
   not show all the fields in the catalog. It only has the fields
   that are permitted in this specific area on the template.

   Certain custom field types (for example, *rich text* fields) can
   only be added to the main section of the page, while other field
   types can only be placed in the
   right-hand section.

   Also note that a custom field can only be added once. If it has
   already been added, you will not be able to add it again in a
   different location on the template.

Built-in Fields
---------------

Built-in fields are default fields that cannot be removed from a
template. See below for a brief description of the built-in fields found
on the Data Source, Schema, Table, and Column object templates.

Note that some of the built-in fields, such as Description or
Sample Content, will always appear on the catalog page even if empty;
however, some other built-in fields will be hidden from the catalog page
unless the source database has the required type of data to fill them.
Unlike the catalog page, the template always shows all built-in fields
available for this object type to allow you to define their location.
Examples of fields which may be hidden if empty are the **Source Comments**, **Table Constraints**, and **View SQL** fields. They are displayed only if the source database has corresponding data.

Rearranging Built-In Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can move built-in fields up and down in the template section
where they are located.

You cannot move built-in fields between sections.

To move a built-in field,

1. On the **Custom Templates** page, select the object
template you want to edit from the list of object templates on the left.

2. Hover over a field in the template. This will reveal the up and down
move icons:

.. image:: ../../_static/DS_Tempate_Customization_01.png

3. Click the up or down arrows to move the field placeholder up or down
in the template section.

4. Click **Save** on the upper-right of the template to save the changes.

.. important::

   When you are working on your templates, remember to save your
   changes to apply them to the catalog page. The template page
   will indicate that there are some unsaved changes by displaying
   an **Unsaved Changes** banner on top of the template:

   .. image:: ../../_static/DS_Template_Customization_02.png

Custom Fields
-------------

You can add and remove custom fields to/from an object template.

Permitted Field Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the main and right-hand sections support a slightly
different set of custom field types:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Both sections                     | - Pickers                        |
|                                   | - Multi-pickers                  |
|                                   | - Dates                          |
|                                   | - Object Sets (22.3 and later)   |
|                                   | - People Sets (22.3 and later)   |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Main only                         | - Rich Texts                     |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Right-hand only                   | - Object Sets (22.2 and prior)   |
|                                   | - People Sets (22.2 and prior)   |
|                                   | - References                     |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Adding Custom Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a single custom field to the template,

1. Click **Insert** in the section and in the location where you would
like to add it,main or right-hand section, in the menu,
click **Custom Field**:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_Add_Field.png

2. The list of custom fields supported by this section of the template
will open:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_Insert_Field.png
    :class: with-border
    :width: 200px

3. Find and click the field you want to add. It will be added to the
template.

4. Save the template to apply the changes: click Save on top right of
the editor:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_13.png 

Removing a Custom Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a custom field from the template, hover over it to reveal
the **Remove** button

.. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Remove.png

Click it to remove the field:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_14.png

Note that this action is safe. It only removes the field from the
template and does NOT remove the field from the catalog.

You will notice that some of the fields in the template do not have
a **Remove** button:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_15.png

These are `built-in fields`_ that cannot be deleted from the template.

Adding and Removing Groupings of Custom Fields
----------------------------------------------

You can add a grouping of custom fields to both the main and right-hand
sections. To add a grouping,

1. In the main or right-hand section, click **Insert** in the location
where you would like to add the grouping, in the menu,

4. In the list of available fields, find and click the field you want to
add to the group. Depending on the section you are editing - main or
right-hand - you will have a different set of supported fields. For example, rich
text fields can only be placed in the main section of the page and
reference fields can only be placed in the right-hand section. Also
note that if a field has already been added to this template as a single
field or as part of a different grouping, it will not be in the list as
a field can only be added once. This list of fields available for adding
includes fields that are supported for this section and have not been
added to the template yet:
