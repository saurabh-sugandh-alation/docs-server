Using Custom Article Templates
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The content fields in articles are completely customizable, so you can
create an article template to host a business glossary page, a wiki page,
or for any other purpose. Alation enables you to create many different
:doc:`custom templates <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/BuildCustomTemplatesforArticles>` for
article objects. For example, your sales analytics team can have unique
fields on their data dictionary article, and the finance team's data
dictionary article can include completely different fields. 

Every time you start a new article, you can select a saved template.

When you associate a template with the article you are creating, the
custom fields you added to this template will appear on the article
catalog page:

After you have selected a template, you can start documenting data in
your article. Make sure to click **Save** when done.

Below, we saved an article that is based on a "Brands" template.

In another example, the business glossary template has a lot of
custom fields added to it:

Here is a business glossary article filled out. The template page has
more fields than the saved Article because the author left some of them
blank. If a field is left blank, it doesn't appear on the saved
article page. Fields can always be updated or completed at any later
time.
