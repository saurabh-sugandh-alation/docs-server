Custom Field Permissions
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

In your catalog, you can restrict users' view and edit access to custom
fields on a catalog page of an object by setting custom field
permissions. You can also regulate who can edit values of built-in
fields by setting edit permissions for built-in fields.

By default, both custom and built-in fields are viewable and editable by everyone.

.. note::

   Permissions are currently applied on the field level but not on the
   specific data object level. If you set permissions for a field, they
   apply to all the templates where this field is added.

A user with the Catalog Admin or Server Admin role can:

-  Grant view or edit permissions for a custom field
   to :doc:`Groups <../../admins/AdminSettings/Groups>` or :doc:`Creating Custom Fields for Catalog Pages <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CreateCustomFieldsforCatalogPages>`  (type of custom field). When
   viewing is restricted, the field is visible only to the groups and/or
   people sets to which the view permission is assigned. When editing is
   restricted, all users who can access the object can see the custom
   field, but only the users who belong to groups/people sets with the
   edit permission can edit the field.
-  Grant Edit permission for built-in fields to groups or people sets.

Groups and people sets must be created before setting permissions.

    .. note::

         If you log in as a Server Admin, go to **Admin Settings** > **Catalog Admin** section > **Customize Catalog** to open the **Customize Catalog** page.

3. Click the **Custom Field Permissions** tab. The **Custom Field Permissions** tab has two tables: **Custom Field** on top and **Builtin Field**, under the **Custom Fields** table. To assign permissions to custom fields, you will be working with the **Custom Field** table. To assign permissions to built-in fields, scroll down to the **Builtin Field** table:

4. Find the field for which you want to assign permissions.
Depending on what kind of permissions you want to apply:

  **Custom Field**

  View: In the column Viewable by, click the **Add Rule** link to
  open the list of available groups and people sets.

  Edit: In the column **Editable by**, click the **Add Rule** link to
  open the list of available groups and people sets.

  **Built-in Field**

  There is no view permission. These fields are viewable by all users on
  all templates. You can only restrict editing of built-in fields. In the
  column **Editable by**, click the **Add Rule** link to open the
  list of available **Groups** and **People Sets**.

5. Select groups and/or people sets from the list. Permissions will be applied to the field and viewing/editing will be restricted to the selected groups and people sets only.
