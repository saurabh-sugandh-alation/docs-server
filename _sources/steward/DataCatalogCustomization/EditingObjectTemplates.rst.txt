Edit Object Templates
======================================

*Applies from Alation version 2023.1.4*

.. note:: 

    This topic describes how to edit data object templates for data sources, schemas, tables, columns, and domains. Other data object templates such as dataflow and BI report are edited in the :doc:`same way as article templates </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/BuildCustomTemplatesforArticles>`.

    For information on editing data object templates in earlier versions of Alation, see :doc:`Editing Object Template Layout </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/EditingtheLayoutofObjectTemplates>`.
    
It is possible to customize object templates in Alation by adding or removing fields, or
rearranging fields added to these templates.

You need a Catalog Admin or Server Admin role to edit object templates.

Object Template Customization Overview
--------------------------------------

When you first open the default catalog page of a data object, data
source, schema, table, column, or domain in the freshly installed Alation catalog,
it has only default fields organized into two sections: a wider main
section and a narrower right-hand section:

.. image:: ../../_static/CustomizeCatalog_DefaultTableView.png

However, you can customize the number of fields and their layout by
customizing the underlying template.

Object Template Components
---------------------------

A template always has some default fields that appear on the catalog page before any customizations are applied. There are two main types of default fields: 

- *object-defined fields*, read-only fields that reference information or functionality associated with a particular object. Object-defined fields can be removed from a template and re-added as part of a group of fields. 
- *writable fields*, such as **Title**, **Description**, and **Stewards**. Writable default fields typically cannot be removed from a template.

*Custom fields* are components that admins can create, add to, and remove from templates. A *group of fields* is just that, a group of custom or object-defined fields added to a template as a single entity that can be moved from place to place within the template.

.. note::

    Object-defined fields may be removed from templates and re-added as a part of a group of fields only if this functionality is enabled. See :doc:`Enable Removability of Object-defined Fields </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/EnableObjectDefinedRemovability>`.

Find the Object Templates in the Catalog
-------------------------------------------

To open the template of an Alation object type:

.. include:: /shared/AccessCustomTemplates.rst

4. Under **Data Object Templates**, find and click the template that you want to edit:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_4.png

5. The template editor page that opens represents the layout of the associated catalog page: the fields and sections you see on the template are displayed in the same order in which they will appear on the catalog page. You can add, remove, and rearrange the template components.

Default Table Template:

.. image:: ../../_static/CustomizeCatalog_DefaultTableTemplate.png

When working on your template, you can open a second browser tab with
the catalog page of a table or column, depending on which template you
are editing. After making and saving the changes to the template,
refresh the catalog page of the object to quickly see the
changes.

What Can Be Modified?
---------------------

On the **Data Source**, **Schema**, **Table**, **Column**, and **Domain** object templates, you can:

-  Add custom fields.
-  Add groups of fields
-  Label groups of fields.
-  Rearrange fields and groups of fields up and down in sections and sometimes left and right between sections.
-  Remove most fields. Fields that cannot be removed will not have the **Remove** (X) button when you hover over the field.

You cannot:

-  See **Related Topics** and back reference fields. They do not
   appear on the template and their position on the catalog page is
   fixed at the bottom of the right-hand section.

.. important::

   The list of fields available for adding to the template does
   not show all the fields in the catalog. It shows only those fields
   that are permitted in this specific area on the template.

   Certain custom field types (for example, *rich text* fields) can
   be added only to the main section of the page, while other field
   types can be placed only in the right-hand section.

   Also note that a field can be added only once. If it has
   already been added, you will not be able to add it again in a
   different location on the template.

Default Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default fields are Alation-defined fields used in constructing default templates. See below for a brief description of the main default fields found
on the Data Source, Schema, Table, Column, and Domain object templates. The first table shows editable fields, the second the object-defined fields.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Note that some of the default fields, such as **Description** or
**Sample Content**, always appear on the catalog page even if empty;
however, some other fields are hidden from the catalog page
unless the source database has the required type of data to fill them.
Unlike the catalog page, the template always shows all fields
available for this object type to allow you to define their location.
Examples of fields that may be hidden if empty are the **Source Comments**, **Table Constraints**, and **View SQL** fields. They are displayed only if the source database has corresponding data.

Custom Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Custom fields </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CreateCustomFieldsforCatalogPages>` are user-defined fields that can be added to templates. Depending on their type, custom fields may be restricted to one section or the other, as described in the following table:


+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Both sections                     | - Pickers                        |
|                                   | - Multi-pickers                  |

Configure the Template
----------------------

You can configure the template by doing any of the following operations:

- Add custom fields.
- Add a group of fields.
- Rearrange fields.
- Remove fields (either custom fields or object-defined fields).
- Order fields in a group.
- Change a group label.
- Remove a group of fields.

Add Custom Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a single custom field to a template:

1. Click **Insert** in the section and at the location where you would like to add it, either main or right-hand section. In the menu that appears, click **Custom Field**:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_Add_Field.png

2. The list of custom fields supported by this section of the template opens:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_Insert_Field.png
       :class: with-border
       :width: 200px

3. Find and click the field you want to add. It will be added to the template.

4. Save the template to apply the changes: click **Save** on top right of the editor:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_13.png 

Add a Group of Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a group of fields to both the main and right-hand sections. To add a group of fields:

1. In the main or right-hand section, click **Insert** at the location where you would like to add the grouping. In the menu that appears, click **Group of Fields**:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_Add_Group.png

2. In the editable area that is added, click **Label Grouping** to activate the field, type a label, and click **Save**. The grouping will be added to the template:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_6.png

3. Next you need to add fields to the group. Hover over the field group you added to reveal the controls to the right of the label and click **Insert**:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_17a.png

4. If you have not removed any default fields, you will see only a list of custom fields at this point. If you have removed one or more default fields, you will be presented with a choice between adding a custom field or adding an object-defined field.

5. In the list of available fields, find and click the field you want to add to the group. Depending on the section you are editing---main or right-hand---you will have a different set of supported fields. For example, rich text fields can only be placed in the main section of the page and reference fields can only be placed in the right-hand section. Also note that if a field has already been added to this template as a single field or as part of a different grouping, it will not be in the list as a field can only be added once. This list of fields available for adding includes fields that are supported for this section and have not been added to the template yet:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_18.png

6. To apply your changes, click **Save** in the yellow **Unsaved Changes** banner on top of the template:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_13.png 

Rearrange Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can rearrange all fields up and down in the template section
where they are located. Many fields can also be moved between sections. Fields that can be moved both vertically and horizontally will display vertical and horizontal arrows when you hover over them:

.. image:: ../../_static/CustomizeCatalog_VerticalHorizontal.png

Fields that can only be moved vertically will have only vertical arrows:

.. image:: ../../_static/CustomizeCatalog_VerticalOnly.png

To move a field:

1. On the **Custom Templates** page, select the object template you want to edit from the list of object templates on the left.

2. Hover over a field in the template to reveal the move icons.

3. Click the appropriate arrow to move the field placeholder as desired.

4. Click **Save** on the upper-right of the template to save the changes.

.. important::

   When you are working on your templates, remember to save your
   changes to apply them to the catalog page. The template page
   will indicate that there are some unsaved changes by displaying
   an **Unsaved Changes** banner on top of the template:

   .. image:: ../../_static/DS_Template_Customization_02.png


Remove a Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a field from the template, hover over it to reveal the **Remove** button:

.. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Remove.png

Click it to remove the field:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_14.png

Note that this action is safe. It does NOT remove the field from the catalog, but only from the template.

You will notice that some of the fields in the template do not have a **Remove** button:

.. image:: ../../_static/Customize_15.png

These are fields that cannot be deleted from the template.

Order Fields In a Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can order the fields in a group of fields. To order:

1. Hover over the group to reveal the controls:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_7.png
       :width: 300px

2. Use the up and down arrows to move the field in the grouping.

3. Save your changes to the template by clicking **Save** in the yellow banner on top of the template area.

   .. image:: ../../_static/Customize_dots.png

2. In the menu that opens, click **Edit Grouping Label**:

3. Change the label and click **Save**:
