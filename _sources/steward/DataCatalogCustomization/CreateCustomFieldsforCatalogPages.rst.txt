Creating Custom Fields for Catalog Pages
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Overview** tab of a catalog page of an Alation object (schema, table,
column, etc.) is composed of fields. When you use catalog pages out of the box, they have some essential default fields, such as tags, stewards, or description. A Catalog Admin or Server Admin can customize catalog pages by
creating and adding custom fields to existing object templates, creating
custom templates for the article objects, and applying permissions to
custom fields.

Sample catalog page of a table object:

.. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Page3.png

On the **Customize Catalog** page in Alation you can create your own
custom fields and add them to the catalog page templates.

Starting with 2022.3, glossary terms may now be used as values for object sets and references custom field types. Starting with *V R6 (5.10.x)*, you can customize the layout of the Table and Column templates. See :doc:`Editing Object Template Layout <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/EditingtheLayoutofObjectTemplates>`.

Types of Custom Fields
----------------------

Alation provides the following custom fields:

- Dates
- Multi-Select Pickers

Adding a Custom Field
---------------------

To work with custom fields and templates, you need a Catalog or Server Admin admin role.

1. Log in to Alation as a Catalog or Server Admin. Click the settings icon on the upper right of the main toolbar:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Screen_Shot_2018-10-16_at_2.17.18_PM.png

   Catalog Admins - In the menu that opens, click **Customize Catalog**. The **Customize Catalog** page will open on the **Custom Fields** tab:
   Server Admins - On the Admin Settings page that opens, click **Customize Catalog** in the **Catalog Admin** section. The **Customize Catalog** page will open on the **Custom Fields** tab:

   .. image:: ../../_static/customfields.png

2. Scroll down to the type of custom field you want to add.
3. Click the **+ (Add)** icon. Note that depending on release, the add icon may be on the right to the field type name or at the bottom of the field list of this type. The new field editor will open on the right.
4. Provide the required information using the prompts in Alation UI.

   .. note::

       Each field type has several required parameters which you will
       need to provide when creating the field. More complex fields will
       have more parameters. For example, when adding object sets and
       references, you will need to specify the target and source field
       names to create back-reference fields on the source pages. For list
       types (pickers and multi-pickers), you will need to create lists of
       available values. Rich texts and dates only require a name and optionally
       tooltip text. 

5. Save your field by clicking the Save icon on top-right:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Save.png 

.. _Create_Custom_Fields_Catalog_Pages-Create_Object_Set_Field:

Creating an Object Set Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An object set field is a complex field that includes two parts:
target and source. The target is the main object set field
that is applied to a template and source is a back reference field
that should appear on the page of the object that is referenced in
the target field.

To create an object set custom field:

1. Click the **Add** icon for object sets. The new field editor will open on the right. There are two sections: **on the Target Page** and **on the Source Page**:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Custom_createObjectSet.png

  .. note::

   In releases up to V R6 (5.10.x), the back-reference part of
   the field is not functional and is addressed in future
   releases. Users will need to provide both target and source
   parameters to save the custom field.

2. In the **on the Target Page** section, enter the plural and singular names for the new custom field and the tooltip text.
3. Under the **on the Source Page** section, enter the **Backref Name** and **Tooltip Text**.
4. Click the save icon to save the changes:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Save.png

  The custom field you created is added to Alation and is displayed in the list of existing fields of the object set type on the left.

Editing a Custom Field
----------------------

1. On the **Customize Catalog** > **Custom Fields** tab, find the custom field to edit.
2. Click the custom field. The custom field editor will open on the right. Make the required changes and click the **Save** icon:

  .. image:: ../../_static/customfieldsedit.png

Deleting a Custom Field
-----------------------

1. On the **Customize Catalog** > **Custom Fields** tab, find the custom field to delete.
2. Click the custom field. The custom field editor will open on the right.
3. Click the **Delete** icon on top right of the editor.

  .. image:: ../../_static/Custom_Delete.png

4. In the confirmation dialog that opens, confirm the deletion. The field is deleted.
