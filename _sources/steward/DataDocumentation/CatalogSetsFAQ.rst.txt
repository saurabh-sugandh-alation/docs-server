-  Is the wildcard match dependent on permissions or a specific
   browser?

Wildcard matches cannot be applied to column level sets (because the set
calculation becomes too compute-intensive.) However, regex matches can
be applied to Table and Schema sets. To implement it, create a Table or
Schema set by selecting Tables or Schemas as the Object Type when
creating the Catalog Set.

.. note::

    If you need to bulk apply metadata to columns in the data catalog,
    we recommend you use the Data Dictionary Uploader.

-  Is there a way to see all items included in the set?

Unfortunately, there is no way to see all items in a set, however, you
can see the first 100 items to get an idea of what objects are being
included in the set. Click the preview button to see the sample.

-  Is there a way to specify items and remove items in a set without
   some rule?

There isn't a way to exclude or include specific objects from a set
without the use of the rules. However, you can use regex matching to
do this for Tables and Schemas.
