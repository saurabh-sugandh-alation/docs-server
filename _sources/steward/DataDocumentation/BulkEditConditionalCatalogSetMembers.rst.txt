Bulk-Editing Conditional Catalog Set Members
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

You can bulk-edit the set members on the **Shared Fields** tab of your
catalog set page:

On this tab, under **Shared Fields as they will appear on Member Tables**, specify the field values you want to share   to all the set members.

.. note::

     The values shared from a conditional catalog set do not override the
     values set by individual users for title, rich text
     fields, such as description, and trust flags. The field
     values shared from a conditional catalog set will show up separately
     and next to the values set by individual users.


 Title, Description, and Trust Flags Shared from a Conditional Set:

However, for the custom field types which only allow a single value,
users may overwrite the shared catalog set field values causing a value
conflict. The conflicting value will be indicated with a warning icon on
the catalog page of the data object:

*Conflicting Value*:
