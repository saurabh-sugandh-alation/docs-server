Catalog Sets

Catalog sets enable you to group pieces of data together to perform
bulk operations on identical or similar data sets. Bulk edits are done
on the page of a catalog set, rather than on the individual pages of
specific data objects, one by one.

When data objects are included into a catalog set as members, you can
update the values of their catalog fields in bulk using this set. You do
not need to describe each object separately: a catalog set is your way
to control built-in and custom field values on the catalog pages of all
set members. Any changes to the set are propagated to all set members.
This keeps catalog field values consistent across all identical or
similar data objects united in sets.

In Alation, on a page of an object, you can understand if this object
is currently a member of a catalog set in the following way:

- Catalog sets that a data object is currently included in as a member are listed under **Sets** in the **Properties** section.
- Shared fields managed using sets have a catalog set indicator icon:

In Alation, you can create two types of sets:

-  Conditional: Data objects will be automatically grouped based on a logical condition.
-  Manual : You will manually select data objects to be united into
   a set. You can also turn on synchronization of field values on
   successive child levels for the set members.
