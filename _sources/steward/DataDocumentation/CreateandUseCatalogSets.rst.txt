Creating and Using Catalog Sets
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Catalog sets enable you to group pieces of data to perform bulk
operations. Bulk edits are done on the **Catalog Sets** page, rather than on
the data object page. 

To create or edit catalog sets, go to ``<YourAlationURL>/catalog_sets/``.

First, you need to title your set and select the data you want to group.  

#. Click to add a new catalog set.
#. Choose a title for your catalog set.
#. Select the data level to include.
#. Indicate the given name of the data for inclusion in the set.
#. Click **Save** to continue.

You can then perform bulk operations. Below, for example, we provided a
**Steward** and **Description**.

Now when you go to any table that includes ``nppes_provider``, you will see
this propagated information:

You can add multiple objects (Columns, Tables or Schemas) to catalog
sets. To do so, you need to use **Match Exact Regex** then
use regex characters. For example, ``table_1table_2table_3``.  

For more information, see our :doc:`Catalog Sets FAQ <../../steward/DataDocumentation/CatalogSetsFAQ>`.
