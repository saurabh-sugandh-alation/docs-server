Enrolling Articles into Agile Approval
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Agile Approval is a collaboration workflow enabling Alation users to
request reviews and provide approvals for Articles, ensuring that these
articles are credible sources of information for everyone. Reviewers can
monitor the edits made by others and either confirm the changes by
approving them or discard them by restoring the last approved version.
The catalog page of an article will indicate the review status of its
content, so that the readers are informed whether or not the article has
been vetted by a subject matter expert and can be trusted.

Turning Agile Approval On
-------------------------

If you want your article to go through the approval cycle, you need to
enable Agile Approval for this specific article and assign Reviewers.

.. note::

    Agile Approval workflow can only be enabled for each article.

Turning on Agile Approval enables the approval workflow for the
article. This means that the content will have to be approved by the
assigned expert, or the Reviewer, before the article receives the
status Approved.

Reviewers step in between creators and consumers of articles and sign
off on all edits. Any changes to articles with Agile Approval on are
monitored and have to be reviewed and approved for the article to
become Approved. Reviewers are notified on both new updates to
the article and the change of status using their *Inbox* . For details
on Inbox, see :doc:`Inbox </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`.

You can turn Agile Approval on and off for articles:

-  You created
-  You have Can Edit access to
-  You are assigned as Reviewer of.

To enroll an article in Agile Approval,

1. In the upper-right corner of the article catalog page, click More and in the menu that opens, click Access. The Access dialog will open.
2. In the Agile Approval panel, click the down arrow then toggle Agile Approval on.

3. In the Assign Reviewers panel that opens, click Add and find and select users or groups to be Reviewers. These users will be tasked with reviewing and approving all changes to the article. They will receive notifications on edits to the article, will be able to add or remove Reviewers and turn Agile Approval workflow for the given article on and off.

  .. note::

     It is possible to leave the article without any Reviewers. In this
     case users with Can Edit access will see an alert on the article page
     reminding to assign someone so that the article can start moving
     through the approval cycle.

     Users added as Reviewers will automatically be granted *Can Edit*
     access if they have not been given this permission before.

4. In the dialog, click Save. The assigned Reviewers will be listed under the Reviewers field on the right of the article catalog page. The page will also display the Agile Approval status *banner* under the title:

  -  Status **This Article Contains Edits and Needs Your Review** will be
     displayed to Reviewers.
  -  Status **Pending Review - Your Edits are Saved and Visible** will be
     displayed to non-Reviewer users with access

5. If no Reviewers are assigned, the catalog page of the article will display a reminder. In the Agile Approval status banner, under **Awaiting Review By**, click assign someone to open the searchable list of users and groups. Find and select users or groups to be Reviewers.
6. Alternatively, you can assign Reviewers by setting values to the Reviewers field on the article catalog page. To add Reviewers, click Add next to the field and in the Users and Groups list, find and select users or groups to be Reviewers. 

Turning Agile Approval Off
--------------------------

If Agile Approval is turned off for an article that was previously
enrolled in it, Alation stops pulling it through the approval
cycle:

- The dedicated Reviewers field is hidden from the article catalog page.

  .. note::

   The system preserves data on latest Reviewers, and they will be
   restored if Agile Approval is turned back on.

- Notifications about this article previously triggered by the Agile Approval workflow will be removed from the users’ inboxes.
- Agile Approval status banners will be hidden from the article catalog page 

If Agile Approval is turned back on, the Reviewers will be
restored, and the article will go to Requires Review state. New
review tasks will be sent to Reviewers again.

.. note::

   The user who turns Agile Approval back on will automatically be added
   as a Reviewer; however, they can remove themselves from the list of
   Reviewers.

Approving an Article
---------------------

Reviewers approve articles to confirm that the content is trustworthy.

Editing an Article with Agile Approval On
-----------------------------------------

Changes to Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with Can Edit access can make changes to the article. If an
article with the Approved status is updated, it will change
the status back to Requires Review.

Although most of the field changes will trigger the Requires
Review status, there are exceptions. Changes to the following fields
will not impact the approval status of the article:

-  Reviewers
-  Contributors
-  Tags
-  Children
-  Attachments

Adding a Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with Can Edit access can add a new template to the article. Adding
a template will cause an Approved article to go to the "Needs Review"
state.

Restoring an Older Version
--------------------------

As the Reviewer, you can restore an older version of an article enrolled
in Agile Approval and, thus, discard any pending edits.

To restore an older version,

#. Open the catalog page of the article that requires your review. Its status will be **This Article Contains Edits and Needs Your Review**.
#. In the Approval status banner, click Open Version  History. The Version History dialog will open. It lists all existing versions of the given article, by time and user, newest on top.
#. In Version History dialog, click View Snapshot for a version you want to restore. The snapshot view of the article will open.
#. Click Restore Version. The article will be restored to this particular version.

Article Review Tasks and Notifications
--------------------------------------

Reviewers will receive notifications about all new edits to the articles
they are responsible for and tasks to review and approve the changes.
Notifications will show up in their Inbox in Alation. Active
Review tasks will be filtered into Assigned to Me view of the
Inbox.

To view notifications and tasks,

#. Click the Activity button on the main toolbar. Your Inbox will open on the right. New notifications can be found in My Inbox folder.
#. Click any Article Review notification to see the details on the edits that require approval.
#. If you want to review and approve the edits right away, click Go to Page  icon in the review notification to open the catalog page of the article. 
#. Alternatively, you can find your active Review tasks under  Assigned to Me on the left. They will be available alongside your Conversation tasks.
#. Click a task to see its details then click Go to Page to open the catalog page of the article directly from the task.

.. note::

    A Review task stays active until the article that triggered it is
    approved and assigned the *Approved* status. While the task is
    active, it receives an update every time the article is edited. All
    edits waiting for review in one review cycle are accumulated in the
    task body.

    After the article is assigned the *Approved* status, the
    corresponding task is deactivated and no longer updates. If new edits
    are made in the approved article, a new review cycle is kicked
    off and a new review task is sent to all Reviewers.
