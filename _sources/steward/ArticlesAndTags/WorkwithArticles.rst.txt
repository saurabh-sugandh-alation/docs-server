Work with Articles
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

An article is a document object in Alation. Articles can be created to
record any useful information about your data objects: from extensive descriptions of concepts to procedures or how-to tips. You can share your Articles for the benefit
of your colleagues and invite others to collaborate on the content.

To systematize the Articles, you can organize them into a `taxonomy`_.  

Viewing
-------

You can find shared Articles using Search. You can also see all
shared Articles as a sorted list or as Taxonomy under Articles in
the left-hand Navigation Menu. To view a specific article, click its
title.

.. note::

   If Articles are mentioned in *Conversations*, in other
   *Articles*, or are added as *Field values*, you can open them by
   clicking their title anywhere in Alation.

List
~~~~~

The List view displays Articles sorted either alphabetically or
chronologically. To switch between sorting options, click the
**sorted by** value then click the sorting option you prefer:
**newest** or **name**. In addition to sorting, you can filter the list
using the text filter.

Taxonomy
~~~~~~~~

The Taxonomy view displays Articles as taxonomies listed
alphabetically by the title of the main parent Article. Taxonomies are created by adding children to a top-level article. Children can be either articles or tables; child articles, in turn, can have children of their own, so that taxonomies can be several layers deep:

Create an Article
-----------------

Articles can be created by users with any role other than Viewer. To create a new Article:

1. In the left-hand Navigation Menu, go to Articles and click |add|. The new Article page will open on the right.

    .. |add| image:: ../../_static/UI_PlusIcon.png

2. In the Title field, type the title. New Articles are created based on the default Article Template. You may want :doc:`to change the Template </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CustomArticleTemplates>` to structure your content in a better way.
3. Hover over the Properties field on the right to reveal the Wrench icon next to the Template label. Click it to open the list of Article Templates available in your catalog.

   .. note::

       Article Templates define the type and number of Fields that
       you find on the catalog page of an Article. A Field can be viewed as
       a "building block" for the Template. The Template is a set of Fields
       that best suit the type of content you are creating. For example,
       you might use a "customer segment" template for documenting terms for an 
       article group on a marketing campaign and a different "Best Practices" 
       Template for tips on querying a Data Source.

       Article Templates can be created by users with Server Admin or
       Catalog Admin roles. For details on creating Article Templates,
       see :doc:`Build Custom Templates for Articles <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/BuildCustomTemplatesforArticles>`.

4. Fill out the Fields on your Article page. For details on types of Fields, see :doc:`Creating Custom Fields for Catalog Pages </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CreateCustomFieldsforCatalogPages>`.
5. To add to or create a taxonomy, either add a child by clicking |add| in the **Children** field and selecting a child article from the list that appears, or find the article that you believe would be a good parent for your new article and add your new article as a child to that one. You must have access to the parent article to edit it.
6. Where necessary, save the changes to the Fields by clicking Save in the top right corner of the Field panel. 

Formatting Text
---------------

For blocks of text, your Article Template will include the Rich Text
type of Fields. You will see a panel with basic formatting functions on
top of the editable area of Text Fields. You can also embed objects such
as the following:

-  Links
-  Tables
-  Emoticons
-  Images
-  Video files

To customize the basic HTML of the text input, on the formatting panel,
click |Code View| to open the HTML code of the input.

.. _At-Mentioning:

@-mentioning
------------

In an article, you can reference any Alation object, such as a User, a
Data Source, or a Query, by @-mentioning it in the text field. To
mention an object, type the @ symbol in the text field. The list of
objects to select from will open.

For Tables, Views, Queries, and Query results, the preview of the object
will be available after you save the Field. To see the preview, click
the Expand icon [+] that comes after the title of the mentioned object.

.. note::

 When you @-mention an object in an article, the article will be
 automatically added to the Relevant Articles field on the catalog
 page of the mentioned object.

Editing
-------

You can edit Articles you created or the Articles you have Edit access to. To edit an article:

#. Open the Article catalog page.
#. Hover over the title of the Field you want to edit to reveal the Edit icon. The image of the Edit icon depends on the type of Field you are editing. For example, it can be Edit for Text, |add| for Object Sets, a list for List Values or a calendar icon for Dates. Click it to edit the field value.

Attachments
-----------

You can attach files to your article in the Attachments Field of the
Article Template.

Deleting
--------

To delete an article, in the top right corner of the article page, click
More and then click Delete. In the Confirm Delete dialog
that opens, click Yes to confirm the action. Your article will be
deleted from the catalog.

Version History and Restoring Versions
--------------------------------------

Alation stores Version History for Articles. A *version* is a saved
snapshot of an Article having a saved update to the value of an
editable Field. To view Version History:

#. On the catalog page of an Article, in the upper right, click **More** and then click **Version History**. The **Version History** dialog opens. It has information on the user who made the change, time of the change, and the **View Snapshot** link for each version.
#. Click **View Snapshot** for a version to open and view its page.
#. To exit the snapshot view, in the Viewing Snapshot panel above the Title, click **Exit View**.

You can restore an older version of an article and in doing so, override
all newer edits. You need to have Edit access to the article to
be able to restore. To restore an older version:

#. Open the Version History of the article and click View Snapshot for the version you want to restore. The snapshot view will open.
#. In the Viewing Snapshot panel under the title, click Restore. The version you are viewing will be restored as the current version of the article.

.. note::

 Some older versions cannot be restored. For example, it is not possible to restore a version that uses a different Article Template.

Click **Invite** in the **Who Can Access** section of the dialog, and in the searchable list that opens, find and select users to manage access for. Selected users and groups will be added to the **Who Can Access** list.
