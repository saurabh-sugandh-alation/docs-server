*Articles* are Alation objects intended for long-form written content. Articles are ideal for internal help content, project documentation, technical and analytic content, and corporate best practices. *Tags* are user-defined labels that you can use to tie together disparate catalog objects such as articles, data objects, domains, and queries.

When writing an article, you can @-mention any piece of data, a user,
or a saved query and directly embed that information. When you @-mention
a piece of data in an article, that article will automatically appear on
the Catalog page of the mentioned Alation object under Relevant
Articles. You can also embed images and videos into articles.

For more information, see :doc:`Working with Articles </steward/ArticlesAndTags/WorkwithArticles>`.

For best practices about writing articles, refer to :doc:`Write Articles to Retain Institutional Knowledge </welcome/BestPractices/WriteArticlestoRetainInstitutionalKnowledge>`.
