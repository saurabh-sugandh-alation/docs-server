Using Stewardship Workbench
=============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation's Stewardship Workbench is part of the Data Governance App. Stewards are able to make updates to the catalog in bulk, instead of navigating to multiple different object pages to make the same change, such as applying a data masking or row access policy.

Selected objects are validated for relevance and the changes will then be applied. For some policy types, only relevant objects will be updated. For example, data masking policies will only update column objects and row access policies will only update table objects in the selection. The user will receive an email notification when policies are successfully applied.

Upon committing changes such as Bulk Add Data Policy or Bulk Remove Data Policy, Alation communicates with Snowflake via bulk processing API to carry out the requested action. Alation sends the requested action to Snowflake to process for the desired objects and after completion of the action, the user will receive an email confirmation. This process is also notified to the user making the update in the final dialog "Request Sent" as displayed in the Bulk Add Data Policy or Bulk Remove Data Policy sections below.

Navigating Stewardship Workbench
------------------------------------

After arriving to the Stewardship Workbench, you will find a search page displaying in table view.

The first column of the results table contains checkboxes that allow you to select one or more data objects. You can filter the results to only show the data objects that you want to edit.

The **Bulk Actions** button contains a menu of all available bulk actions.

Bulk Add Policy
-----------------------------------------

In 2022.1.3 and later, the ability to add policies in bulk was incorporated into Stewardship Workbench.

.. note::

   An :ref:`Object Set custom field must be created <Create_Custom_Fields_Catalog_Pages-Create_Object_Set_Field>` and added to the Policy catalog template page in order to perform bulk addition of policy to objects.

1.  After filtering the results to only show the objects that you want to edit, select the checkboxes for the objects you want to apply the policy to. If you would like to add the policy to all objects, select the checkbox in the header row.

  .. image:: ../../_static/sw_ex1a.png

  .. note::

      If objects are selected to add a policy to for which a policy cannot be applied, an error message will display.
