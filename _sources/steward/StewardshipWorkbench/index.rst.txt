The Stewardship Workbench is part of Alationâ€™s **Data Governance App** and can be accessed from the **Data Governance Page**. To aid in efficient data governance, the Stewardship Workbench allows for curation of multiple objects from a centralized workbench.

From Alation 2023.3.0, a table **stewardship_bulk_action** showing statistics on bulk curation is available in Alation Analytics. The table includes information such as what type of action was taken, when the action was started and finished, who performed the action, and whether the action succeeded.

Stewardship Workbench is priced and packaged separately from the Alation Data Catalog as part of the Data Governance App. Contact your account manager to learn more about pricing and licensing for the Data Governance App.
