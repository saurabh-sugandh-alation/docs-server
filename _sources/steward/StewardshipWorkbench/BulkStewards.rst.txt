In 2022.2 and later, the ability to add and remove Stewards in bulk was incorporated into Stewardship Workbench.

Bulk Add Stewards
--------------------

1. After filtering the results to only show the data objects that you want to edit, select the checkboxes for the columns for which you want to apply the Stewards. If you would like to add the Stewards to all columns, select the checkbox in the header row.

    You may select items from the page you begin selecting items from, as well as continuing on to subsequent pages and select additional items from those pages to include when applying the bulk change.
