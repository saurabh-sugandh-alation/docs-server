Bulk Update People Sets
=============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

In 2022.3 and later versions, the ability to update people sets in bulk is incorporated into the Stewardship Workbench.

.. note::

   Legacy articles and article groups are not supported in bulk actions. The new term is based on LMS (while legacy articles/article groups are not), hence current support for bulk updates is for new glossaries and terms.

1. After filtering the results to show the data objects that you want to edit, select the checkboxes for the columns you want to update. If you want to update all columns, select the checkbox in the header row.

The following are the methods you can choose to use to apply updates:

    - Adding selected values to current values: Selected options will be appended to the existing options.

    - Replacing selected value with another value: Selected options will be replaced with the options selected.

    - Replacing all current values with selected values: Selected options will be removed and replaced with the values selected.

    - Removing selected values from current values: Selected options will be removed.

5. Click the **Update** button. You will see a warning that the you are about to perform a bulk update action that cannot be undone. Click **Continue** to submit the change.

If the server could not be reached due to network connectivity issues or the request to update people sets is unsuccessful, a failure alert will display.
