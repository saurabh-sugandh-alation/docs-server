Working with the Catalog Activity Report
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from release V R4 (5.8.x)*

To view the  changes in the data object structure and to check on the continuous curation effort, you can refer
to the Catalog Activity report. **Catalog Activity** report will be available if :doc:`My Stewardship Dashboard <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/StewardshipDashboard>` is enabled in Alation.

The **Catalog Activity** report can be accessed by users wearing the Data
Steward/Curator Hat. (For details, see :doc:`Hats in Alation <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/StewardshipDashboard>` ).

The **Catalog Activity** report captures both changes to the physical
metadata of data objects and updates to the properties and
custom fields of both Data Sources and their child objects, for
example: 

-  Tables created and/or dropped in a schema (physical metadata change)
-  Columns added to or removed from a table (physical metadata change)
-  Data type of a column changed (physical metadata change)
-  Custom field values changed for a specific object by a specific user
-  Starting with V R6 (5.10.x), custom field values changed through a catalog set

.. note::

   In *V R4 (5.8.x)* changes to such fields as Title and Description are
   not included in the **Catalog Activity** report.

   Starting with *V R5 (5.9.x)* changes to Title and Descriptions are
   part of the report.

   Starting with release V R6 (5.10.x), changes made through catalog
   sets are also included.


The **Catalog Activity** report is available in two views: a personalized view
for the logged-in user on **My Stewardship Dashboard** and the full view across all data sources on the dedicated **Catalog Activity** page.

Data Steward Personalized View
------------------------------

On **My Stewardship Dashboard**, **Catalog Activity** report is filtered to only
display changes that affect Data Sources where the logged-in user is steward.

.. note::

   To assign someone as a steward to a data source, add this user as a
   value to the **Stewards** field on a data object:

   - Data Source
   - Schema
   - Table
   - Column

The **Catalog Activity** report on **My Stewardship Dashboard** includes information on:

-  Schemas, Tables, and Columns affected by changes to custom fields -
   note that Title and Description fields are only included in the
   report starting with version V R5 (5.9.x); and changes shared from
   catalog sets are only included starting with version V R6 (5.10.x)
-  Details of the change
-  Time of the change

To open **My Data Stewardship** dashboard,

1. Sign in to Alation and make sure to wear the Data Steward/Curator hat.
2. On the main toolbar, click **Curate**
3. Click **My Stewardship Dashboard**. The **Catalog Activity** report will be available on this dashboard.

.. note::

   The **Curate** menu will be available if

   -  My Stewardship Dashboard is enabled in your Alation instance
   -  You are wearing the Data Steward/Curator hat


**Catalog Activity Report** view on **My Stewardship Dashboard** (V R6):

Viewing Field History
---------------------

You can view custom field history right from the **Catalog Activity** report
by hovering over a row and clicking **History** for this row. For
details on field history, see :doc:`Viewing Field History <../../sources/WorkwithCatalogData/ViewFieldHistory>`.

Viewing Changes Shared From Catalog Sets
----------------------------------------

Available from release V R6 (5.10.x).

Changes shared from a catalog set will be displayed as one row, under
the name of this catalog set. The **Catalog Activity** report will not list
each individual catalog set member as changed. The row that holds a
catalog set name should be understood as a collective change relevant
to all the members of this set:

.. image:: ../../_static/Cat_Act3.png

If you filter the report by Steward is value, the catalog
sets listed in the report indicate that there exist member objects with
this Steward property, which are affected by changes through this
catalog set.

Full View Catalog Activity Report
---------------------------------

To view the full report on all catalog activity happening in Alation,

#. Sign in under the Data Steward/Curator hat.
#. On the main toolbar, click **Curate**.
#. In the menu that opens, click **Catalog Activity**. The **Catalog Activity** page will open.

Alternatively, you can go to the full view right from **My Stewardship Dashboard** by clicking **All Catalog Activity** icon in the top right corner of the personalized report view.

The full report features two separate tabs:

-  **Curation Changes** tab that lists changes to custom fields except for Title and Description
-  **Physical Metadata Changes** tab that lists metadata changes

**Curation Changes** tab (V R6):

Applying Filters to Curation Changes
------------------------------------

There may be many changes to custom fields in an actively used
catalog instance. To bring into focus changes to specific data objects
or specific fields, you can apply filters to narrow down the segment of
changes you are viewing.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 7 7 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value and Conditions
     - Options
     - Description
   * - Data Type is
     - Data Sources, Schemas, Tables, Columns
     - Select the Alation object type to view the curation changes for. Select Any Type to view all.
   * - WITHIN

   * - AND

   * - Field Changed is

     - In the custom field list, select the fields to view the changes for. Select Any Field to view all. If you don’t see the field you’re looking for in the list, try searching for it. For performance reasons, we do not show all custom fields in the initial list. If you do not see the required value in the list, start typing its title in the Filter quick search. The list will update to display values that fit your search criteria.

     - Using the calendar, set the week for which to display the curation changes.

Curation Changes Report Details
-------------------------------

The Curation Changes report displays the following information:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 35
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description
   * - Object affected by the change
     - Datasource, Schema, Table or Column affected by the change.
   * - Change details
     - Details on what kind of change was made.
   * - By User
     - User who performed the change.
   * - Time of change
     - Time when the change was made.

.. note::

     If the Steward filter is set to your name, it means you are
     only viewing changes that affected Alation objects you are currently the
     Steward of. The report will not display the objects that
     you used to steward in the past but no longer currently steward.

Viewing Field History
---------------------

You can open the field update History for a specific field right from
the **Catalog Activity** report by clicking **History** in the
corresponding row.

Restrictions on Report View
---------------------------

The **Catalog Activity** report will only display changes to objects which the
logged-in user has permissions to view. This means that you can:

- only see changes to Alation objects you are granted access to in the database. If you do not have permission to view the object that is set as a value for a field, the change to this field will appear to you as it would on the catalog page.

- only see changes to the fields you are allowed to see in the catalog. For details on custom fields, see  :doc:`Creating Custom Fields for Catalog Pages <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CreateCustomFieldsforCatalogPages>`.

Example:

You have permission to view Table A. You do not have permission to access Table B.

There is an Object Set type of custom field "Tables" on an Alation
object you are viewing that is set to "Table A". Its value is
changed to "Table B".

In the **Catalog Activity** report, this change will appear to you as
" Tables changed: *Table A* -> *Not Set* " because you cannot view Table B.

Physical Metadata Changes Tab
-----------------------------

Applying Filters to Physical Metadata Changes Tab
-------------------------------------------------

To focus on the metadata changes of specific objects, you can apply a
number of filters. Filters are joined with AND logic.

Digest Emails
-------------

If you have subscribed to the **Metadata Change** email notifications, you
will receive a weekly digest email on all metadata changes to objects
you are the steward of. The digest email is sent out on Monday and
includes updates from the previous week. It is limited to changes in 20
Schemas and 20 Tables, but includes the link to the full view of the
**Metadata Change** report. For details on notifications, see :ref:`Email Notifications Preferences <Edit_Profile-Email_Notification_Preferences>`.
