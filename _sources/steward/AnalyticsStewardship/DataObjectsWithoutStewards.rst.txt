Data Objects Without Stewards
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from release V R3 (5.6.x)*

The **Data Objects Without Stewards** report is intended to help catalog
curators to determine  which data objects in their catalog still do not
have a Steward. It provides a quick way to assign one.

**My Stewardship Dashboard** shows a summary chart of the **Data Objects Without Stewards** report.

The full report can be accessed:

-  from the **Curate** menu using the **Data Objects Without Stewards** link.
-  from **My Stewardship Dashboard**, clicking the **Detailed View** link on the upper right of the report.

Summary Chart on My Stewardship Dashboard
-----------------------------------------

It is a donut chart summary of data objects with and without a steward
that provides an insight into how many of the data objects still require
a curator to lead the catalog enrichment effort.

The summary chart can be filtered by data type or by a specific data
object using the natural language filter. 

- **Data Type** List filter with such options as Data Sources, Schemas,
  Tables, and Columns. Use this filter to narrow the report down to one type of catalog objects.
- **Filter in** Quick filter that allows searching for and filtering
  for a specific object. You can search among Data Sources, Schemas, and Tables cataloged in your Alation instance.

Both the filters work in the same way as on the :doc:`Curation Progress <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CurationProgress>` report.

Full Data Objects Without Stewards Report
-----------------------------------------

This page displays a more detailed view that includes both the donut
chart summary and the **Per Object Details**. The **Per Object Details** view lists the specific objects which do not have a Steward. By default, it displays 25 rows per page and is sorted by Popularity in descending order.

The resulting table can be sorted by **Name**, **Title**, **Curation Progress** or
**Popularity** by clicking on the corresponding column name:

-  **Name** Name of the object.
-  **Title** When available, the title assigned by Alation Lexicon and confirmed by a user.
-  **Curation Progress** Curation progress value for each object,
   See :doc:`Understanding the Curation Progress Value <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CurationProgress>`.
-  **Popularity** Popularity of the object. By default, the table is
   sorted by popularity in descending order. 
-  **Steward** This column has a control that allows assigning a steward to the data object directly from the report.

Assigning a Steward
-------------------

To assign yourself as a steward, click **Assign To Me** for an object.
This action will add you as a steward to this object, and your username
will be added to the **Steward** field on its catalog page.

You can also assign a different user or even a group as a steward. To assign someone other than yourself,  

#. Find the desired object in **Per Objects Details** view and click the down arrow on the right of the **Assign To Me** button to open the quick search field.
#. Enter the name of the user or group and select them from the resulting list.


Alternatively, you can select **User** or **Group** from the **Showing** list then scroll through the names and select the desired user or group.

After the user or group is selected, the **Steward** column will change from
a button to the name of the selected user or group.

To remove or change the assignment, use the X icon next to the name.
