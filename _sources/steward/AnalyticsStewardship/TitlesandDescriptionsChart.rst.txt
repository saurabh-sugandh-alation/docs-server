Using the Titles and Descriptions Chart
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Titles and Descriptions Chart** is available under the **Curate**
menu, if your current :doc:`hat <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/StewardshipDashboard>` is set to
``Curator``. It is a page that allows you to track
titling and descriptions in Alation over desired date ranges.

.. note::

    In releases before *V R7 (5.10.x)*, if the **Stewardship Dashboard** is not enabled, the Titles and Descriptions chart is available to the Curator hat as the **Governance Tracking Dashboard** located under the **Track** menu.

You can analyze how many titles and/or descriptions of data
objects are:

- guessed by ALLIE but unconfirmed by a user
- guessed by ALLIE and confirmed by a user
- hand-populated by a user

For more about ALLIE, see :doc:`Auto-Titling <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/AutoTitling>`.

The data will be displayed in a graph displaying the selected date range.
The default view is the current month.  As you mouse over the dates in
the graph, the donut chart to the right of the graph will display values
for the selected date to include:

- **Guessed and Unconfirmed**
- **Guessed and Confirmed**
- **Hand-Populated**
- **Blank**
- **Total**

The values the donut chart displays related to the date that can be seen
directly above the donut chart.

Filtering
---------

The page displays two charts, by default the top chart is for titles and
the lower chart is for descriptions. Filtering is separate for each chart/donut chart pair.

Chart Type
----------

The first filtering option in both charts is to select the chart type. It can be either **Title** or **Description**.
