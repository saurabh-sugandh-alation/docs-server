**My Stewardship Dashboard** features reports designed for data governors to
evaluate and prioritize curation efforts on the data sources they are
supervising and, eventually, generate the maximum value out of their
catalog. Alation captures and stores the history of modifications to the cataloged data objects.

The **Curation Progress** report is a weighted measure of the completeness
of data catalog documentation that is intended to help Data Stewards in
monitoring and managing the curation of data objects. The report displays the overall progress for each data
environment in the catalog and makes it possible to drill down to the
details for each data object, enabling you to prioritize the curation effort.

**My Stewardship Dashboard** is only available for some roles. See :doc:`Roles Overview V R7 (5.12.x) <../../welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>`.
