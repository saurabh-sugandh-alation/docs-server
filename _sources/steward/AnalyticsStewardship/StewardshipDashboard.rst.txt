*Available from release V R3 (5.6.x)*

Enabling My Stewardship Dashboard
---------------------------------

.. note::

     Starting with release *V R6 (5.10.2)*, **My Stewardship Dashboard** is
     always enabled. There is no longer a switch in Labs that would
     allow to enable it and no need to perform any enable actions.

This requires the role of a Server Admin.

To turn on the stewardship dashboard, 

#. Click the **Admin Settings** icon on the upper right to go to the **Admin Settings** page.

#. Under the **Server Admin** section, click **Labs** then find and turn on the toggle for **Enable Stewardship Dashboard**. 
#. Click **Save changes** on top right of the page then confirm by clicking **Change Lab Features** in the **Verify Change Labs Features** popup dialog.

After the feature is enabled, you will see that the **Track** menu on the
main toolbar has changed to the **Curate** menu. In the background, an
initial curation computation job will be triggered to compute the
curation progress for all the data objects currently in the catalog.
This background job will take time depending on the size of this data.
On average, it can take between one to five hours to complete.

.. note::

    Until the initial calculation background job is completed, **My Stewardship Dashboard** will have no data to display.

Accessing My Stewardship Dashboard
----------------------------------

When **My Stewardship Dashboard** is enabled in your Alation instance and
you are currently wearing the Data Steward/Governance Officer hat, you
will see the **Curate** menu on the top toolbar. It lists the links to
the dashboard and a separate view of each of the Stewardship reports.

My Stewardship Dashboard
------------------------

The first option is **My Stewardship Dashboard**. When selected, it
takes you to the dashboard page with the following summary views:

In versions before V R4 (5.8.x):

- :doc:`Curation Progress <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CurationProgress>`
- :doc:`Data Objects Without Stewards <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/DataObjectsWithoutStewards>` reports

From V R4 (5.8.x) and above:

- :doc:`Curation Progress <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CurationProgress>`

How is the Stewardship Dashboard Updated?
-----------------------------------------

Initial Dashboard Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you turn on the flag in the **Labs**, an initial
bulk calculation background job is run to compute the curation progress for all
the data objects in your catalog. This will take some time depending on
the size of data, usually, one to five hours depending on the amount of data.
If you open **My Stewardship Dashboard** page from the **Curate** menu while the
initial job is running, the reports will be empty. This
initial bulk job only runs once. Later, **My Stewardship Dashboard** reports
will be updated with incremental update background jobs.

Keeping the Reports Up-to-Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All changes to curation progress are computed using incremental update
jobs which are triggered by such events as:

-  Title and Description changes on Data Source, Schema, Table or Column types of Alation objects 
-  Custom Field value changes, including  adding/removing Stewards in the UI or using the API
-  New fields being added or existing fields being removed from the
   custom template of the Data Source, Schema, Table or Column
-  An MDE job runs and new objects are created or old objects are deleted
-  Deleting a Data Source
-  Restoring a deleted Data Source
-  Updates using Catalog Sets

Weekly Synchronization Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of release V R5 (5.9.x), we added a new sync job that runs every
Saturday night and adds missing data objects, cleans up deleted data
objects, and updates the curation progress of all the existing data objects.
