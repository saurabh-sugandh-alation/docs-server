Work with the Lexicon - 2020.4 and Later
================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

**Server** and **Catalog Admins** can view all the matches between abbreviations and expansions registered in the Lexicon on the dedicated **Lexicon** page.

Access Lexicon
-------------------
See `Access Lexicon <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/WhatisLexicon.html#access-lexicon>`_.

Lexicon UI Tour
------------------

Once the Lexicon job has run, the **Settings > Catalog Admin > Lexicon** page will display the list of all mappings between abbreviations found in the data object names and expansions that Alation has computed for the abbreviations as shown below:

.. note::

    Alation computes expansions using the text data it finds in your catalog as input to find possible expansions that are real words.

You can also upload your list of abbreviation-expansion matches into the Lexicon. Uploaded expansions will be added as confirmed by a user. See :doc:`Configure Lexicon Manually and Upload Lexicon <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/ConfigureLexiconManuallyandUpload>`.

Explore Lexicon

    - **Confirmed** - Applying this filter will only display the abbreviation-expansion matches confirmed by users.

#. Confirm - Click the **Confirm** icon to confirm the abbreviation-expansion.

#. Reject - Click the **Reject** icon to reject the abbreviation-expansion.

The change will be applied system-wide when the Lexicon job runs the next time. Alation will use the confirmed expansions to generate auto-titles with higher confidence.

.. important::

      The text filter on the Lexicon page is case sensitive.

Functional Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can narrow down the focus even more by using the functional filters. You can apply one filter at a time from any of the three filters:

- All or Confirmed or Unconfirmed

Filters change the focus in the following way:

All
^^^^^^
Applying this filter will display all the abbreviation-expansion matches confirmed by users, unconfirmed abbreviation-expansion matches and the abbreviations for which Alation was unable to compute an expansion.

Confirmed
^^^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will only display the abbreviation-expansion matches confirmed by users.

.. image:: ../../_static/Lex_workwith06_20204.png

Unconfirmed
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will only display unconfirmed abbreviation-expansion matches and the abbreviations for which Alation was unable to compute an expansion.
