Titling Your Data
=====================================================================

Alation inherits the database names from all data objects and allows you
to provide a logic title in addition. These titles can be used in
Compose when you write your queries.

There are two ways to title data objects:

1. Add the title manually by clicking on the pencil icon and writing out the name.Â

2. Use the green or red icon next to a title to confirm or discard an Alation-generated title. Title confirmation or rejection on a catalog page of a data object currently applies to this specific object only, in all releases up V R6 (5.10.x). If you want to apply title confirmation/rejection system-wide, you must do so on the dedicated page of Lexicon.
