Configure Lexicon Manually and Upload Lexicon
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The Lexicon feature in the
Alation platform allows users to provide one or more expansions for
common abbreviations used in the names of database objects in their
environment. Alation will use the expansions for an abbreviation to
automatically create titles for any database objects that have that
abbreviation.  

To upload Lexicon information that is not captured in the
metadata from the connected data sources, Alation users can leverage the
Upload Lexicon command-line script.  This process will append the new
abbreviations and expansions to the existing lexicon and will not
overwrite any content that was in the lexicon before the upload.

Below are the instructions for running this script.

Step 1: Prepare an Input File
---------------------------------------------

You can upload Lexicon from a CSV file.


.. important::

   If your source CSV file includes Unicode characters, make sure it is encoded in UTF-8.

The Upload Lexicon script expects a two column CSV file as input.  The
first column of the CSV file is for the abbreviation that will be added
to the Lexicon or already exists in the Lexicon.  The second column is
for the new expansion that is to be added to the Lexicon for the
abbreviation in the first column.  Multiple expansions for a single
abbreviation will need to be represented on separate lines. Here is an
example of an input file:

::

   abbreviation,expansion
   amt,amount
   cst,cost
   cst,customer
   bal,balance

.. note::

    The input file should not have any empty rows and does not need a header row.

Step 2: Copy the Input File to Alation Server
---------------------------------------------

After the input file is created following the format specified
in Step 1, the file will need to be moved to the Alation Server.  Using a file transfer
utility of your choice, such as Filezilla, scp, or sftp, transfer the input
file from your computer to a temp directory on the Alation server.  Your
Alation administrator will have the details required for setting up this
transfer, such as the name/IP address of the server and the credentials
required for login.  After the file transfer has completed, you will
need to move the file to the ``/opt/alation/alation`` directory so that it
is visible in the chroot environment.  To do this, execute the
following command:  

.. code-block:: console

   sudo mv /<temp directory>/example_file.csv /opt/alation/alation/  

Step 3: Change Ownership to alation
---------------------------------------------

After successfully transferring your input file to the Alation server,
ensure that the file is owned by the Alation service ID (alation).  If
you transferred the file to the Alation service with an ID other than
the Alation service ID, have your Alation administrator login as root
and run the following command. Replace ``<input file name>`` with the name
of the file you created in Step 1.

.. code-block:: console

   sudo chown alation:alation <input file name>

Step 4: Log in to the Alation Shell
---------------------------------------------

Now that the input file is in the correct location, you will need to
first log in to the Alation shell.  To log in to the Alation shell, run
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

If you see output similar to this, you have successfully logged into the Alation shell: 

.. code-block:: console

   This is an Alation shell on a production server. If you got here in error, use ^D to exit.

Step 5: Log in to the Django Shell
---------------------------------------------

You will then need to log in to the Django shell to run the Upload
Lexicon script.  To log in to the Django shell and execute the script,
run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   alation_django_shell

Step 6: Execute the Upload Lexicon Script
---------------------------------------------

1. Initialize the Upload Lexicon script:  

   .. code-block:: python

      from lexicon.upload import upload_csv

#. Assign the location of your file to the path variable. Replace ``<input file name>`` with the name of your file, and note that the given path is inside the chroot.

   .. code-block:: console

      path_to_file = '/<input file name>'

#. Execute the Upload Lexicon script. Replace ``<userID>`` with the ID of an Admin user.

   .. code-block:: console

      upload_csv(path_to_file, <userID>)

#. Exit the Django shell:

   .. code-block:: python

      exit()

.. note::

    The userID value is found at the end of the URL for your profile page
    in Alation. In the screenshot below, "99" is the userID.
