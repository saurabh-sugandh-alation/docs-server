Working with Policies
=================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Policies are a generic type of Policy object that can be found using Search and managed in the Policy Center. You can link objects in the Catalog to a policy using an Object Set field. Since policies are a unique object type, they are discoverable using Search. Search results can also be filtered to show only policies.

  .. note::

    The default template of the policy object does not include any Object Set fields. Catalog or  Server Admins can create Object Set fields in **Settings** > **Customize Catalog** and add to the Catalog template of the policy object (see :ref:`Policy Templates <policy_templates>` section). After this, linking to other Catalog objects using Object Set fields is available upon manual creation of a Policy.
