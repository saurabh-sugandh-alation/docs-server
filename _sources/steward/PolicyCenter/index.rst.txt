Alation's Policy Center is part of the Data Governance App. Alation surfaces data policies as the result of metadata extraction and ingestion, ensuring that data consumers are aware of their existence. This fosters a more ethical data culture.

Policy Center provides a single location for managing policies and data policies alike. Users can view policies extracted from the catalogued data sources as well as data objects associated with these policies. They can also take advantage of curated information found on dedicated Catalog pages of each Policy object.
