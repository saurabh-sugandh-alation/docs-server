*Applies from version 2022.2*

Policy Center users can now categorize policy objects to help organize them by grouping them together into Policy Groups. Users in a role of Catalog Admin or Server Admin have access to create these groups. One policy can be added to multiple Policy Groups. Policy Groups have a dedicated Catalog template and can be curated using custom fields associated with the template and are discoverable using Alation Search and Search filters. The Policy Groups table appears on the top of the page, while policy objects are listed in the All Policies table underneath the Policy Groups table.
