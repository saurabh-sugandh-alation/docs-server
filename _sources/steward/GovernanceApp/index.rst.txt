*Applies from version 2021.4*

Alationâ€™s Data Governance App allows for a comprehensive view and management of the various aspects of data governance at an organization. Stewards can use the Governance Dashboard, Workflow Center, Policy Center, and the Stewardship Workbench in order to further drive their governance initiatives. The Data Governance App is priced and packaged separately from the Alation Data Catalog. Contact your account manager to learn more about pricing and licensing for the Data Governance App.

Catalog growth and the curation effort can be tracked through the Governance Dashboard. Configuration and management of workflows in the Workflow Center ensures auditability and transparency of approval processes across the catalog. Security and compliance objectives are maintained through visibility into how policies are mapped to data in the Policy Center. All of these are central components of the Data Governance App.
