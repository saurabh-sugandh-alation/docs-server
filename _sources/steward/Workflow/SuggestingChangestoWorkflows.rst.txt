Suggest Changes Flow
-------------------------

When a user views a page that is part of a workflow, they may make suggestions to change the item. This is accessible on each field of RDBMS object type (data source, schema, table, column). After submission of a suggestion, reviewers will receive a notification and task to evaluate the userâ€™s suggestion to the workflows the reviewers are responsible for. The change management workflow review process also includes policy pages, policy groups, glossary, and terms (not available for legacy articles). Users who have been assigned as a reviewer and the creator of the object will only see the **Edit** button in place of **Suggest Change**, this is by design and allows for changes to be made without going through the workflow review process.

To suggest a change for consideration:

1. Click the **Suggest Change** button.

2. The **Suggested Changes** dialog appears. On the left side an editable version of the field is available. On the right side is a visual representation of the workflow, along with the reviewers indicating how many must approve to make it to the next step and approval. Make suggested changes to the field on the left.

3. If you want to review the differences between your changes and what currently exists, select the **Show Diff** button to see a comparison between both. You can toggle this view by then selecting the **Hide Diff** button.

4. When ready to submit the suggested change for review, click the **Submit for Review** button.

Once the suggested changes have been submitted, the **Suggest Change** button on the field that has been edited is now greyed out. You can hover over the button and an explanation that your recent suggestion is being reviewed is displayed.

If you would like to retract your suggestion, this can be done by clicking the **Remove My Suggestion** button and then the **Save & Close** button.

Review Changes Flow
-------------------------

When a user who is a reviewer views a page that is part of a workflow that has a pending suggested change, they can review the proposed change by hovering over the **Suggest Change** button and clicking **Review Change** from the tooltip that appears.

Note that a **Reject** selection by any reviewer at any step of the process will remove and deny the suggested change.

To review a suggested change:

1. Hover over the **Suggest Change** button.

2. Click the **Review Change** button. The **Reviewing Suggestion** dialog appears.

Once the review has been submitted, the steps of the review process on the right side are updated.

The green checkmark indicates that reviewer Mark Tedin in the above example has approved the suggestion. His date of approval is shown when hovering over the checkmark as well. The yellow circle to the right of Third (a group of users) indicates that a member of the group has approved the suggested change (Mark also is a member of the Third group).
If both the individual reviewer Joel Mack as well as Reid or Tom (who are members of the Third group) also approve - then the suggested change will proceed to the next step in the workflow.

When the final step has received the necessary approvals for the suggested change, the change will be published for all users.

-------------------------

When a user who is a reviewer views a page that is part of a workflow that has multiple pending suggested changes, they can review the proposed changes from the page. Note that a **Reject** selection by any reviewer at any step of the process will remove and deny the suggested change.
