Managing Workflows
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation currently supports two types of workflows:

1. **Add Object Request:** An Add Object Request is used when a new object is to be added to the catalog. Currently, Add Object Requests are supported only for new glossary terms. This workflow has two major use cases:

     a. Creation of new terms: ensuring that any new term created inside a glossary goes through a review process.
     b. Association of existing terms to a glossary: ensure that for a glossary under a workflow any new or existing terms added to the glossary go through a review process before being included in the glossary.

2. **Change Request:** A Change Request is used when someone has a suggested change to title, description, or any custom field available on the catalog pages of objects under the workflow.

Create an Add Object Request Workflow
--------------------------------------

To create an Add Object Request workflow:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

      :class: with-border

6. Under **Select Glossary objects to include under this workflow**, choose **All** or **Select** to select specific glossaries:

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_selectGlossaries.png
      :class: with-border

7. If you chose **All**, you are given the choice to exclude specific items from the workflow:

     .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_excludeItems.png
       :class: with-border

8. Click **Next**. 

9. A summary of the workflow appears. Click the **Add Reviewers** button to specify the names or user groups from whom approval is required. 

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addterm_summary.png
      :class: with-border

10. Specify a minimum number of reviewers (from 1 to 9 inclusive), or specify that all reviewers are required to approve. Click **Add Users** to specify individual users by name, or **Add Groups** to specify user groups as reviewers. 

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addterm_addreviewers.png
      :class: with-border

11. You can allow your reviewers to skip the workflow by switching the toggle labeled **Reviewers of this step can bypass the entire workflow.**

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addterm_reviewersskip.png
      :class: with-border

12. When you have finished adding reviewers, click **Done**.

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addterm_specifyreviewers.png
      :class: with-border

13. Additional review steps can also be added at this point if desired by clicking the **Add a Step** button. When you are satisfied that the workflow is complete, click **Publish**.

Create a Change Request Workflow
---------------------------------

To create a Change Request Workflow:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

   .. image:: ../../_static/data_governance2.png
      :class: with-border

3. Click the **+ Create Workflow** button, then select **Change Request**.

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_create2.png
      :class: with-border

4. Enter a desired title for the workflow. The title of the workflow must be unique and the field will alert you if a duplicate title already exists. Click the **Next** button.

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_title.png
      :class: with-border

5. The initial workflow dialog appears. It contains a single menu, labeled **Select Catalog Object**. Click the label to expand the menu:
 
   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_selectobject.png
      :class: with-border
   
6. Select a catalog object type from the menu to see the main dialog:

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_top2.png
      :class: with-border

7. Under **Start workflow when a change suggestion is made on**, either select one or more objects from the **Select items** menu or select **All**. The dialog changes to reflect the object type and any objects that can be contained within the selected object type. Data sources contain schemas, tables, and columns. Glossaries contain terms. Policy groups contain policies and data policies. Sample screenshots are shown for reference:

   Data source dialog example (version 2023.1.5 and later)

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflowds.png
      :class: with-border

   Glossary dialog example (version 2023.1.7 and later)

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflowglossary.png
      :class: with-border

   Policy group dialog example (version 2023.1.7 and later)

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflowpg.png
      :class: with-border
   
8. By default, the workflow starts when a change is suggested on an object of the selected type or any of the types contained within it. You can choose which objects trigger the workflow by clicking the object type to clear a given type. At least one type must be selected. In the following example, the workflow starts when a change is suggested on a table or column:

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_dstabcol.png
      :class: with-border

9. From Alation version 2023.1.5, you can specify individual fields to be included in the workflow: **Title** and **Description** fields for all object types, **Policy Type** or **Term Type** if applicable, and arbitrary custom fields. Select the specific fields you want to track, or select **All** to include all fields. 

10. Once you have selected the objects and fields you are tracking, you may optionally choose to exclude some specific objects from the workflow. The following example shows a Glossary workflow with two terms excluded:

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_glosswithex.png
      :class: with-border

11. From Alation version 2023.1.7, if you are creating or editing a workflow for Glossaries, Terms, Policies, or Policy Groups, you may allow *creators* to bypass the workflow by setting the toggle **Creators will bypass this entire workflow**. If the toggle is set, any changes to a glossary, term, policy, or policy group by the author of that item will not go through the review process and will be published directly. (This meaning of creator is unrelated to the :doc:`licensing concept of a Creator </admins/AdminSettings/License>`.) 

     .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_creatorbypasson.png
      :class: with-border

12. Confirm your selections and click **Next**. A dialog appears describing the steps of the workflow with a button to **Add Reviewers**:

     .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addreviewersbutton.png
      :class: with-border

13. Add desired reviewers by clicking the **Add Reviewers** button. The **Change Request Workflow: Step 1** dialog opens. You can specify a set of reviewers and a minimum number of reviews needed to move the review forward, or require that all reviewers approve before moving forward. Reviewers can be individual users, groups, people sets, or a combination of all three.

     .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_changerequeststep1.png
      :class: with-border

    .. note::

        It is recommended that you not use only people sets as reviewers. People set reviewers are per object and in some cases may not be defined or have too few members to reach the threshold alone. If only people sets are selected as reviewers and the threshold is not met, a warning message will display.

14. You can allow your reviewers to skip the workflow by switching the toggle labeled **Reviewers of this step can bypass the entire workflow.**

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_changerequest_reviewersskip.png
      :class: with-border

15. After adding the reviewers for Step 1, click **Done**. A dialog appears showing the start conditions and the Step 1 review:

    .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_changerequeststep1done.png
      :class: with-border

    Additional review steps can also be added at this point if desired by clicking the **Add a Step** button.

16. When the workflow has all desired steps, click the **Publish** button to make the workflow available to all users.

Publishing Workflows
-------------------------

Publishing is the final step in creating a workflow and will make the selected workflow available to all users for use and to suggest changes as necessary. Admins may choose to unpublish a workflow for a variety of reasons, such as making further edits or while planning best practices with other users and admins. When ready to restore previously created workflows that you would like to publish:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

.. image:: ../../_static/data_governance.png

3. Click the three dots (â€¦) on the row of the workflow you want to publish.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_ellipses.png

4. Click **Edit Workflow**. A dialog appears where you can edit the selected workflow, if necessary.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_edit.png

5. To proceed with publishing the workflow, click the **Publish** button. To discard your edits, click the **Cancel** button.

.. image:: ../../_static/change_request_reviewers.png

6. Click the **Publish** button to make the workflow available to all users.

Unpublishing Workflows
-------------------------

A workflow can be unpublished and will make the selected workflow unavailable to all users for use and to suggest changes as necessary. Admins may choose to unpublish a workflow for a variety of reasons, such as making further edits or while planning best practices with other users and admins. All active change requests will be suspended when the workflow is in an unpublished state. For previously created workflows that you would like to unpublish:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

.. image:: ../../_static/data_governance.png

3. Click the three dots (â€¦) on the row of the workflow you want to unpublish.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_unpublish.png

4. Click **Unpublish Workflow**. A message appears to confirm your wish to unpublish the selected workflow.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_unpublish_conf.png

5. To proceed with unpublishing the workflow, click the **Unpublish** button. To retain the workflow as-is, click the **Cancel** button. Once the **Unpublish** button is selected, the workflow is no longer available to users and cannot receive suggested changes.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_unpublished.png

Deleting Workflows
-------------------------

Deleting of workflows can also be accomplished from the **Workflow Center**. Please note that when deleting a workflow, that although the resulting actions from the workflow are retained (a suggested change to a field that was accepted and implemented for example), the workflow history is also removed. History of change suggestion, approval, rejection, and deletion are also removed from view upon associated workflow deletion.

To delete workflows:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

.. image:: ../../_static/data_governance.png

3. Click the three dots (â€¦) on the row of the workflow you want to delete.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_ellipses_editdelete.png

4. Click **Delete Workflow**. A warning message appears informing you that this is a permanent deletion.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_delete_conf.png

5. To proceed with deleting, type "**DELETE**" in all caps in the text field.

6. Click the **Delete Workflow** button.

Renaming Workflows
-------------------------

To rename workflows:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

.. image:: ../../_static/data_governance.png

3. Click the three dots (â€¦) on the row of the workflow you want to rename.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_ellipses_editdelete.png

4. Click **Rename Workflow**. A dialog appears where you can rename the selected workflow.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_title_rename.png

5. To proceed with your renamed workflow, click the **Save and Close** button. To discard your edits, click the **Cancel** button.

Editing Workflows
-------------------------

To edit workflows:

1. From the **Apps** menu, click **Govern**.

2. Click **WORKFLOWS** to access the **Workflow Center**.

.. image:: ../../_static/data_governance.png

3. Click the three dots (â€¦) on the row of the workflow you want to edit.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_ellipses_editdelete2.png

4. Click **Edit Workflow**. A dialog appears where you can edit the selected workflow.

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_edit2.png

5. To proceed with your edited workflow, click the **Publish** button. To discard your edits, click the **Cancel** button.

Viewing Workflow Data in Alation Analytics
-------------------------------------------

From Alation version 2023.1.5, you can view workflow data in Alation Analytics. Three tables with workflow data are available in the **public** schema:

- **workflows** summarizes all existing workflows
- **workflow_requests** summarizes the progress of triggered workflows
- **workflow_request_actions** summarizes the actions taken during a triggered workflow

The latter two tables provide a history of workflows as they are triggered and worked through.
