Enabling Workflow Center
-------------------------

An Alation Server Admin with access to the backend of the Alation server is required for enabling **Workflow Center**.

To enable **Workflow Center**:

1. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Server Admin** > **Feature Configuration**.

2. Toggle **Alation Data Governance App** to the **On** position if not already configured. Note that this app is priced and licensed separately from the Data Catalog and must have been purchased from Alation before enabling. The Alation Data Governance App must be purchased and toggled on for access to workflows functionality.

3. Toggle **Workflows** to the **On** position.

4. Click the **Save** button.

5. Stop, then restart uWSGI. Note that this will make Alation unavailable for users for several minutes during the restart process. You can use the following command on the host server - from inside the Alation shell by a user with sudo permissions.

To restart uWSGI:

    1. SSH to your Alation instance.

    2. Enter the Alation shell.
