Glossary Permissions
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from version 2022.3*

In your catalog, you can restrict users' view and edit access to glossaries and glossary terms by setting permissions.

By default, glossaries and glossary terms are viewable by everyone. If a user does not have view permissions for a glossaries and glossary terms, the user will not see the object in Alation.

Glossaries and glossary terms must be created before setting permissions. Only a Catalog Admin or a Server Admin can create new glossaries.
Permissions of glossary terms can be inherited from a glossary of which it is a member. In order to delete, edit, or adjust permissions for an object a user must be a Catalog Admin, Server Admin, the creator of the object, or have been granted Edit permission.

- If a glossary or glossary term has differing permissions at the object level and glossary level, the object level permissions will be adhered to.

- If a glossary term is included in more than one glossary (and each group has different permissions) and inherits permissions from linked glossaries, the permissions will inherit the set of permissions from the glossary which is more restrictive.

- Custom field permissions supersede glossary and glossary term permissions. For example, if a custom field is contained within a glossary term and has permissions limited to read-only for all but two users, the glossary term will also be limited to read-only for all but those two users.

A user with Steward role can:

-  Manage permissions for glossaries and glossary terms they create and for others in which they have been added as editors.
