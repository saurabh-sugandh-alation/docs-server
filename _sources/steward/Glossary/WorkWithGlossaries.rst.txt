Work with Glossaries
=====================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation Glossaries are built from *glossary terms*. Each glossary term has a specific *term type template*. You use glossaries to document business concepts: you can start by creating new glossary terms with their definitions.

.. note::

    Before Alation release 2022.2, glossaries were created by associating articles using a particular template. This type of association is now called an :doc:`article group </steward/ArticleGroups/index>`. If you created glossaries using articles, you can migrate those articles to glossary terms using the Bulk Utility. See :doc:`Migrate Articles to Glossary Terms </steward/Glossary/MigrateArticlesToGlossaryTerms>`.

As you work with glossaries, keep the following in mind:

- Glossaries can be created only by Catalog Admins or Server Admins.
- A glossary title, description, and templates can be edited only by Catalog Admins or Server Admins. This includes restoring values from history.
- A glossary can be deleted only by Catalog Admins or Server Admins.
- In the Glossary terms table, users can see only those terms that they have permission to view.
- If a user does not have permission to see a custom field value, the field value is shown as **Not Set**.

Open the Glossary Hub
------------------------

The **Glossary Hub** is a one-stop destination to view all your glossaries and glossary terms in a single place. To launch the **Glossary Hub** from the **Apps** menu, click **Glossaries**.

---------------------

You need the role of the Catalog or Server Admin to be able to create glossaries.

To add a glossary:

1. On the **Glossary Hub** page, click **Create Glossary** in the upper right corner of the page. The **Untitled Glossary** page opens:

To remove a term from a glossary:

#. Open the glossary page.
#. Find the term you want to remove in the terms table.
#. Click the three-dot icon to the right of the term's description, and then click **Remove from Glossary**.

Create Terms under a Workflow
------------------------------

To add a glossary term when a workflow is applied to glossary term creation: 

#. Open the **Glossary Hub** and click **Create Term**. The **Create Term with Glossaries membership** dialog opens:

   .. image:: ../../_static/Glossaries_CreateTermWithMembership.png
      :class: with-border

#. Select the glossaries you want the term applied to, and click **Save**.

   If you know ahead of time that you will select only one glossary, you can skip this dialog by going directly to the desired glossary and clicking the **Create Term** button there.
   
   The **Untitled Term** page opens:
   
      .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addglossaryterm.png
        :class: with-border

   The top of the page indicates that this term is a **Draft pending submission**. The bottom of the page contains a button labeled **Submit for review**. 

#. Add a **Title** and, optionally, a description or definition.
#. Under **Type**, choose a term type from the dropdown list. If necessary, add an appropriate term type template.
#. When you are satisfied with the glossary term, click **Submit for review**. 
#. The top of the page now reads **Under Review** and the button at the bottom changes to **View Review Status**.
   
   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addglossaryterm_underreview.png

      :class: with-border

Review a Glossary Term
-----------------------

If you are a designated reviewer, you will receive an email notification whenever a new term is submitted for review. Glossaries that have terms under review will have an **Under Review** tab listing the terms needing review:

.. image:: ../../_static/workflow_termsunderreview.png
   :class: with-border
   
Click on a term to open the review.

The term under review appears somewhat differently from how it appears for the author. The top of the page says **Under Review**, as it does for the author, but the button at the bottom reads **Approve or Reject**.

   :class: with-border

To approve or reject the glossary term:

   .. image:: ../../_static/workflow_addglossaryterm_reviewandapprove.png
      :class: with-border
   
#. Click **Approve** to approve the term; click **Reject** to reject the term.
#. Click **Save & Close**.

Work with the Glossary Terms Table
-------------------------------------

You can filter the glossary terms tableÂ and add, remove, and rearrange the columns. 
By default, the glossary terms table shows the term titles, descriptions, and term types, along with the glossaries the term is a member of.

.. image:: ../../_static/glossaries_termtable.png
   :class: with-border

Filter
~~~~~~~~~

To filter the table, start typing in the **Filter** table field. The
content will update to display only the terms for which any custom
field value matches the text you entered.

Sort
~~~~~~~

By default, the terms in a glossary are sorted
alphanumerically by title. You can reverse the sort order by clicking **Term**.

Add, Remove, and Rearrange Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need the role of the Catalog or Server Admin to add, remove,
or rearrange columns of the terms table.

To add, remove or rearrange the columns, click the |columns| icon to open the **Column Organization** menu:

.. |columns| image:: ../../_static/UI_ColumnsIcon.png

.. image:: ../../_static/UI_ColumnOrganization.png

1. To add a column, select the corresponding checkbox in the list. This list is formed from all the custom and built-in fields in the available Term Type templates. A maximum of 20 columns can be added to the table.

   .. important::

       If a user does not have permission to view the values of a specific
       field on a specific term, they will appear as *Not Set* to this
       user.

2. To remove a column, clear the corresponding checkbox. The **Title** column cannot be removed.
3. To change the order of the columns in the table, hover over the field name to reveal the move icon:

   .. image:: ../../_static/UI_MoveIcon.png

   Click it and drag and drop the field onto a new place in the list.

4. To reset the order back to the order in the column list, click **Reset**.
5. Click the **Column Organization** icon to close the menu:

   .. image:: ../../_static/UI_ColumnsIcon.png

You can save your terms table view of a glossary for everyone
in Alation. To make your view default, click **Save View** in
the **Save View for Everyone** banner above the terms table.

      :class: with-border

#. In the confirmation dialog that opens, confirm you want to delete the glossary.

Deleting a glossary does not delete terms associated with it.


Watching, Starring, and Conversations
------------------------------------- 

You can watch and/or star a glossary and start a conversation from the glossary page.

Starring and Watching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To star a glossary, click the star icon on the upper right of the glossary page:

.. image:: ../../_static/UI_StarIcon.png

Starring a glossary adds it to the list of your
favorites in Alation. To remove the glossary from your favorites list,
click the star again. An orange star means the object is currently in
the favorites list, while gray means starring is not applied.

To watch a glossary, click the watch icon on the upper right of the glossary page:

.. image:: ../../_static/UI_WatchIcon.png

Watching signs you up for email notifications. You
will get notified whenever another user makes a change to the glossary.
To stop watching, click the watch icon again. Orange means watching is toggled on,
while the gray watch icon means it is off.

Starring and watching Alation objects makes them easy to find and
navigate to in Alation. You can quickly find the list of objects you have
starred or are watching or by clicking
the star or watch icons in the Filters area of the full-text search.
