Run Lexicon to Suggest Words
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

You can enrich article groups in your
Alation catalog with suggested words generated by Lexicon. To generate
the suggested word, you will need to run the Lexicon job, which requires
the role of Catalog Admin or Server Admin. After the Lexicon job is
completed, the suggested words can be found on the **Suggested Words** tab
of the **Article Groups** page.

Each suggested word is automatically linked to the data objects the
names of which are relevant to this word:

- their names include at least one abbreviation that Lexicon has associated with the word
- they have a title or an auto-title that matches the abbreviation.

.. note::

     Lexicon is a system job that computes comprehensive titles for data
     objects in your catalog to facilitate understanding and
     finding the right data.

     Lexicon processes the names of such data objects as schemas, tables,
     and columns, lists the abbreviations it finds in these names, groups
     similar abbreviations together, and maps such a group to
     an expansion, which is a comprehensive word or phrase that Lexicon generates
     for a group of similar abbreviations.

     Expansions produced by Lexicon are used to create suggested words for
     article groups. Lexicon groups abbreviations together if they appear to refer to the same or similar concept. Objects whose names or titles include one or more of these abbreviations are considered *relevant objects*. Each suggested word is a Lexicon expansion linked to a list of such relevant objects.

If Lexicon provides a useful suggestion, you can add the
Lexicon-suggested word to an existing or new article and an article group. This automatically adds references to all the relevant data
objects to the article in a dedicated field, **Related Data Objects**:

A reverse reference that mentions this article appears on each of the
linked data object pages in the **Relevant Articles** field:

The Allie the Robot icon next to the article title indicates that the article references this data object as part of the **Related Data Objects** field from a suggested term.

Automatic Lexicon Runs
----------------------

To access the Lexicon-generated words, click **Article Groups** on the
**Apps** menu, and then click **Suggested Words**.

.. important::

     You need either the Catalog or the Server Admin role to open
     this tab. It cannot be accessed by users with other roles and appears to them as disabled.


This tab may be empty if the Lexicon job has never run. Note
that the Lexicon job runs automatically every Sunday. After this
computation completes, the most up-to-date suggested words list will be
displayed in Alation.

You can also trigger this job manually on demand. For details, see `Run Lexicon Manually`_.

           .. note::

                After all these three stages are completed successfully, the
                whole job will be assigned the Succeeded status, which will be
