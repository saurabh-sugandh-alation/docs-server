Work with Suggested Words
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Article Groups** > **Suggested Words** tab displays candidate words for your
article groups :doc:`suggested by Lexicon <../../steward/ArticleGroups/RunLexicontoSuggestTerms>`.

The Suggested Words table has the following information:

-  **Word** Actual word suggested by Lexicon after analyzing the
   database names of schemas, tables, and columns.
-  **Abbreviations** List of all abbreviations that Lexicon has
   matched to the specific suggested word. An abbreviation is a
   string found in the names of data objects, which is extended by
   Lexicon into a full comprehensive word.
-  **Related Objects** Total number of `Related Objects`_ (schemas,
   tables, or columns).
-  **Popularity** Normalized value of the sum of popularities of all
   the data objects which Lexicon considers to be related to the
   suggested word. Note that suggested words are pre-ordered by
   popularity by default.
-  **Actions** Reject or Add.

You can filter the table using the natural language filter field on top.

Related Objects
---------------

The Related Objects list is key to understanding the suggested words. Each
suggested word is associated with a list of links to data objects,
Related Objects, which the Lexicon suggests are relevant to this word:

-  they have names which include at least one abbreviation of the word.
-  the expanded abbreviation is present in the title or auto-title of the object.

Example:

Assume Lexicon has discovered data objects with names that
have such strings as ``desc``, ``descr``, and ``description``. These objects
also have the word ``description`` as their titles or auto-titles. Lexicon
infers that they may stand for description, offers ``Description`` as
a suggested word, and lists ``desc``, ``descr``, and
``description`` as abbreviations of the suggested word
``Description``. All the data objects that have at least one of these
abbreviations in their names and where ``Description`` is present in the
title or auto-title will be listed as **Related Objects** for the
suggested word "Description".

If a suggested word is useful to your catalog, you
can add it to an article and an article group. See `Add a Suggested Word to an Article Group`_.

If it does not, you can reject it. See `Reject Suggested Words`_

Add Suggested Words to an Article Group or an Existing Article
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can add a suggested word to an existing article or add it to an
existing article group in a new article. This will add the Related Objects
list in this word to the Body of the article (existing or new).

.. note::

   You may view the ability to add suggested words to articles as a way
   to bulk-link data objects relevant to the information in
   the articles.

Adding a suggested word to an article group creates a new article for that
word and attaches it to the article group you have selected.

Articles created or modified by adding a suggested word will always have
a section titled Related Data Objects. On the respective
catalog pages of these data objects, the article having the **Related Object** section will be mentioned in the **Relevant Articles** field.

Note that as soon as the word is added to an article, it
disappears from the suggested words list. However, if the article
created for this word is deleted, the word will reappear.

Removing the related objects section from the article also returns the
word to the suggested words list.

Add a Suggested Word to an Article Group
----------------------------------------

To add a suggested word to an article group:

1. On the **Suggested Word** tab, find the word you want to add. For this word, click **Add** then click **As New Article**:

  .. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_SuggestedWords_NewArticle.png
    :class: with-border

2. In the list of article groups that opens, find a specific article group you want to add the word to. You can filter the list using the filter field.

3. In the list, click the article group to which you want to add the word. This action opens a new article page based on the template of this article group. The title of the article is pre-populated with the suggested word. The new article also includes a **Related Data Objects** field that lists all the data objects (schemas, tables, and columns), which have names relevant to the word:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Lex_Add_to_ArticleGroup.png
    :class: with-border

  .. note::

     If an article group is associated with multiple templates, you will be able
     to select which template to apply to the new article created for the
     suggested word.

     Also note that suggested words can be added only to article groups that
     already have at least one template associated with them. It is not
     possible to add a suggested word to an empty article group.

Add a Suggested Word to an Existing Article
----------------------------------------------

To add a suggested word to an existing article,

1. For this word, click Add then click **To Existing Article**. This will open the list of articles existing in your catalog. To find a specific article, filter the list using the  filter field.

  .. important::

      Articles can be linked to only a single suggested word: you cannot
      add multiple suggested words to the same article. One article
      can only hold one Related Objects section that points to one
      suggested word.

2. Click the article to which you want to add the word:

  .. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_SuggestedWords_AddToExisting.png
    :class: with-border

3. The name of the article will appear next to the word in the **Suggested Words** table. This allows you to instantly undo the addition, if necessary. To un-select the article, click the cross next to the article title:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Lex_Cancel_Add.png
    :class: with-border

When you leave or reload the **Suggested Words** page, the addition will be
confirmed, and the **Related Data Objects** field that lists all the
relevant data objects (schemas, tables, and columns) will be added to the selected article.

Reject Suggested Words
-------------------------

Rejecting a word removes it from the list of suggested words. Rejected
words disappear when the user navigates away from the **Suggested Words** tab or reloads the page.

Words can only be rejected one by one.

To reject a suggested word,

Click **Reject** for the word:

.. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_RejectSuggestedWord.png
  :class: with-border

The action name will change to **Undo** allowing you to instantly
cancel the action. However, if you leave or reload the page, the
rejected word will disappear from the **Suggested Words** list. It will NOT
re-appear when the Lexicon job runs the next time.

Edit Abbreviations List
--------------------------

You can manually revise the list of abbreviations that Lexicon included
in a group by adding other abbreviations or removing some of them.
This will revise the list of relevant objects linked to the word.

To edit the list of abbreviations,

1. On the **Suggested Words** tab, hover over the group of abbreviations you want to edit. This will reveal the |edit| icon to the right:

    .. |edit| image:: ../../_static/UI_PencilIcon.png

    :class: with-border

3. To add an abbreviation, click the **Add** button:

  .. image:: ../../_static/UI_AddButton.png

  Click the add icon to open the quick filter. Find the abbreviation you want to add and click it to add to the list:

  .. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_Edit_Abbrev3.png
    :class: with-border

4. To remove an abbreviation, hover over the abbreviation you want to remove. This will reveal the |delete| icon on the right.

   .. |delete| image:: ../../_static/UI_DeleteIcon.png

   Click the delete icon to remove the abbreviation.

5. The list of **Related Data Objects** on the right of the editor does NOT immediately update. Click **Close** at the bottom of the dialog to return to **Suggested Words**.

  .. note::

     Updating the list of abbreviations after a change may take some time
     and will not immediately be reflected in the list of **Related Objects**
     or **Suggested Words**. After the change is completed by the system,
     both the list of abbreviations and related objects will be updated.
     You can refresh the page to see the updated lists.

View the Related Data Objects
--------------------------------

On the **Suggested Words** tab, under **Related Objects**, you can see the
number of data objects (schemas, tables, and columns) that are relevant
to the suggested words. 

To view the list of these objects, click the number of objects in the **Related Objects** column:

.. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_ViewRelated1.png
  :class: with-border

In the dialog that opens, all the objects will be listed under **Related Data Objects**. You can filter the table using the natural language filter on top:

.. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_ViewRelated2.png
  :class: with-border

.. important::

    Users can see only the data objects they have database permissions
    for. If you do not have database access to a data object, you will
    not see it in this list.

If you add a suggested word to an article, the data objects matched to
this word by Lexicon will also be added to this article in
the **Related Data Objects** field. This way, you can always access
them directly from this article.

Edit Related Objects List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with the Catalog or Server Admin roles can edit the **Related Objects** list by adding more matched abbreviations or removing some of
the abbreviations that form this list. See `Edit Abbreviations List`_.

It is also possible to edit the **Related Objects** list directly from the article where they are added. Click the **Edit** button to the right of **Related Data Objects** to open the **Abbreviations** editor. See `Edit Abbreviations List`_  for more details.

Remove Related Data Objects From the Article
----------------------------------------------

Users with the Catalog Admin or Server Admin roles can unlink the related data
objects added from a suggested word and the article by removing the
**Related Data Objects** field from this article. Note that when the
field is deleted from the articles, the system will return the word to
the **Suggested Words** table on the **Article Groups** page.

Removing the **Related Data Objects** section from an article does NOT
detach this article from the article groups it is associated with.

To remove the related objects from an article, click **Remove** to the right of the title **Related Data Objects** and in the dialog that opens, confirm the action. The data objects and the article will be unlinked.
