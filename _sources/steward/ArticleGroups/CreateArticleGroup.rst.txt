*Article groups* are collections of articles sharing one or more common article templates. An article group shows only articles with the designated templates that are assigned to that article group. Any
article that has one or more of the designated templates associated with it will show up
in the article group.

Article groups may be created in two ways:

- If you created article-based glossaries using versions of Alation 2022.1 and earlier, those glossaries will be relabeled as article groups when the **Glossary Terms GA** feature flag is enabled. See :doc:`Migrate Articles to Glossary Terms </steward/Glossary/MigrateArticlesToGlossaryTerms>` for details.
- You can create article groups from scratch using the **New Article Group** button on the **Article Groups** page of the catalog.

Create a New Template 
--------------------------------

Because article groups are defined in terms of shared templates, you should define any new templates you want assigned to the article group before creating the article group. See :doc:`Build Custom Templates for Articles </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/BuildCustomTemplatesforArticles>` for details.
