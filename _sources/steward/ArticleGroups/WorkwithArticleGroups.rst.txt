Work with Article Groups
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

To view all article groups in your Alation catalog:

Sign in to Alation, and in the **Apps** drawer, click **Article Groups**.
The **Article Groups** page will open which lists all existing article groups and
their properties, such as:

-  **Title** Title of the article group
-  **Description** Description
-  **Template** Template(s) the article group is associated with
-  **Articles** Number of articles currently in this article group

.. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_Main.png
   :class: with-border

You can filter the list of article groups based on the content in
the **Title** and **Description** columns. To filter, start typing in
the **Filter** field above the table that lists the article groups. The
contents of the table will be filtered based on the text you type. Note
that this filter works only with the content of the **Title** and
**Description** columns and does not take into account
the **Template** and **Articles** columns.

You can sort the **Article Groups** table by the **Title**. Click **Title** to apply sorting.

To view a specific article group, click its title. The corresponding catalog page of this article group will open.

Hide Articles and Article Groups
--------------------------------

From Alation 2023.3.1, a Server Admin can hide all UI entrypoints for articles and article groups, including the **Articles** section in the left-hand navigation, the **Article Groups** app in the **Apps** drawer, and the **Articles** and **Article Groups** items from the **Documentation Types** and **More Types** dropdown in Search. This also disables the POST, Update, and Resurrect endpoints of the Article public API.

To hide Articles and Article Groups, go to **Admin Settings** > **Feature Configuration** and activate the toggle labeled **Hide all entrypoints in the UI for Articles and Article Groups**.  See :doc:`Feature Configuration </admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>` for information on enabling features on that page.

Work with the Articles Table
-------------------------------------

You can filter the articles table, sort it by multiple columns, and add, remove and rearrange the columns.

Filter
~~~~~~~~~

To filter the table, start typing in the **Filter** table field. The
content will update to only display the articles for which any custom
field value matches the text you entered.


.. note::

   The field does not have to be added as a column to the **Articles** table:
   search looks at the fields that are currently associated with the templates added to this article group.

Sort
~~~~~~~

By default, the articles in an article group are sorted
alphanumerically by title. You can sort by a different column or
by multiple columns.

.. important::

    Sorting only works for the fields that are
    of **picker**, **multi-picker**, and **date** types. Sorting cannot
    be applied to fields of other types.

The **Sort Content** dropdown above the table lists all
the columns that support sorting:

.. image:: ../../_static/UI_SortContentDropdown.png
   :class: with-border

Also note that the columns which
support sorting are clickable when you hover over them, while the
columns which do not support sorting are not.

Sort by a Single Column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To sort by a single column, click this column in the table: the names
of the columns for the picker, multi-picker, and date types will be
clickable.

You can also choose a field in the **Sort Content** dropdown:

.. image:: ../../_static/UI_SortContentDropdown.png

Sort by Multiple Columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To sort by multiple columns, select the fields to sort by in the
**Sort Content** dropdown:

1. Click the sort icon:

   .. image:: ../../_static/UI_SortContent.png

   To open the Sort menu, click **Sort by a Column** and click the name of the field to sort by. The sorting by this column will be applied. Remember that by default the table is sorted by **Title**, so in most cases you will see Title as the first sorting column and you will be asked to sort by another column. To choose another column as the first sort, either delete **Title** by clicking the **X** next to its name or simply click on the desired first column before opening the **Sort** menu.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_AddSortField.png
      :class: with-border

2. Click the sort icon again then click **Sort by Another Column** and click the name of another field to add to sorting. The sorting by this column will apply in the sorting by the first field. If there are articles with identical values for the first sorted column, they will be sorted in this group by the second column.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ArticleGroups_AddAnotherSortField.png
      :class: with-border

   The order in which the sorting is applied will be indicated next to the
   column name.

   Sorting Order:

3. To change the order of the columns for sorting, click the sort icon:

   Hover over the field name to reveal the move icon to the right:

   .. image:: ../../_static/UI_MoveIcon.png

   Click it and drag and drop the field to a new place in the list.

4. To remove sorting for a column, click the **X** icon next to the field name.

You need the role of the Catalog or Server Admin to add, remove,
or rearrange columns of the article table.

1. To add a column, select the corresponding checkbox in the list. This list is formed from all the custom and built-in fields found on all the templates associated with this article group. A maximum of 20 columns can be added to the table.

   .. important::

       If a user does not have permission to view the values of a specific
       field on a specific article, they will appear as *Not Set* to this
       user.

2. To remove a column, clear the corresponding checkbox. The Title column cannot be removed.
3. To change the order of the columns in the table, hover over the field name to reveal the move icon:

   Click it and drag and drop the field onto a new place in the list.

4. To reset the order back to the order in the column list, click **Reset**.

Changing Article Templates

    if it uses a template associated with this article group. Private articles
    are invisible to article groups.

Removing an Article From an Article Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove individual articles from an article group.

#. Clear the checkboxes of the article groups you want to remove this article from. Removing an article from an article group will also remove any templates associated with this article group from the article. If the article has only templates associated with the article group, you will need to first add a template that is not associated with the article group, and only after that remove the article from the article group.

Alternatively, you can remove the article from an article group by directly
removing the template(s), which are associated with a specific article group
from this article.
