Set up and Populate Virtual File Systems
=====================================================================

A virtual file system source does not have an active connection to the actual file system and does not support automated extraction. To populate
the Catalog pages for a virtual file system, use `Alation File System API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/file-system-apis>`_.

With this API you can add Catalog pages for *directory* and *file* objects. You can also upload logical metadata into your file system, including titles
and descriptions for all objects using `Custom Field API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/custom-field-overview>`_.

Virtual file system sources support all standard functionality of Catalog pages, for example, custom fields, tags, and data quality flags.
