Access to File Systems
=======================

*Applies from release V R7 (5.12.3)*

Access to file system sources in the Catalog is controlled by the **Privacy** settings of each specific source. Similar to data sources, file systems can be **Private** or **Public**.

File system privacy is an Alation Catalog setting and does not mirror any permissions from the file system itself.

Private File Systems
----------------------

Private file systems can only be accessed by users who are explicitly assigned as *Viewers* or *File System Admins* to this specific source. Only these allowed users can discover private file systems using Search or see them on the **Sources** page.

*Viewers* can view the Catalog pages of file system objects and the extracted metadata.

*File System Admins* can access and update the settings of a source.

    .. note::

        The Viewer access is not the same as the Viewer user role. The Viewer access to a source only gives permission to access this specific source and does not regulate access to parts of the Catalog or its functionality.

Public File Systems
---------------------

Public file systems can be viewed by all Alation users. They can be discovered using Search or opened from the **Sources** page. The notion of a *Viewer* does not exist for a public file system as such sources are visible to all users by definition. The only type of access available for a public file system is *File System Admin*. A File System Admin can work with the settings of a file system source.

Configuring File System Privacy
----------------------------------

An Alation admin who adds a file system source to Alation can set **Privacy** to *Public* or *Private* and give access to other users and groups assigning them as *File System Admins* or *Viewers*.

Only users assigned as *File System Admins* to a file system source can access its settings.

Users with the *Server Admin* role can give the *File System Admin* access to themselves.

From *V R7 (5.12.x)*, if the **Viewer role** enforcement is enabled on your Alation instance, access to a file system settings will require the roles of the *Server Admin* or *Source Admin*. If it is disabled, a user with any role can be assigned as a File System Admin and access the settings page.

To set or change the privacy of a file system source:

1. Click the **Settings** icon on the file system source page to open its settings:

2. The settings page will open on the **Access** tab. Under **File System Privacy**, select either **Public File System** or **Private File System**:

3. To assign *File System Admins* and *Viewers*, under **People**, click **+Add** and in the Quick Search that opens, find and select the user or group to whom you want to give access:

4. The user or group you selected in the Quick Search will be added to the **Viewers & File System Admins** table under **People**. If your file system source is **Private**, further specify the access level by selecting *Viewer* or *File System Admin*. If it is **Public**, the access level is only *File System Admin*:

File System Access and Viewer Role Enforcement
------------------------------------------------

From version *V R7 (5.12.3)*, if the Viewer role is enabled on your instance, this will impact how users access the file system settings.

Viewer Role Enforced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only admin users (Source, Server, and Catalog Admins) can function as *File System Admins* and access the settings of a file system source.

.. note::

    The Quick Search does not filter users based on their role and users with non-admin roles are listed in the Quick Search results too. However, Viewers, Composers, and Stewards will not have access to settings even if they are assigned as File System Admins.

Viewer Role Not Enforced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with any role can be assigned as *File System Admins* and access the settings page.
