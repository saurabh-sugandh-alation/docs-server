Hive with AWS Glue Metastore
============================

There are a few specific steps in setting up a Hive data source with the
metastore on AWS Glue.

Hive with AWS Glue Metastore uses :doc:`Default Hive <../../datasources/Hive/DefaultHive>`.

.. note::

   AWS Glue Data Catalog can be configured with multiple Hive instances.
   Currently, filtering is not available in the AWS Glue catalog for the
   different instances that are connected. It is recommended to
   configure one AWS Glue account for a Hive instance.  

Connectivity
------------

Confirm that Alation can reach your server on the following port. The default port is 10000. There is no port for AWS Glue.

Metadata Extraction
--------------------

The extended metadata extracted includes the following: **Owner information**, **Table Location**, and **Created Time**.

If MDE fails with an exception "Error Serializing dbobjects: The
security token included in the request has expired", check the
values you provided for the **Access Key ID** and **Access Key Secret** both
should be valid. This type of error is caused by expired Access Key
ID and Access Key Secret. Ensure that the user account needs to be active
for existing users.

If a user deletes the access key by mistake, generate a new access key:

1. Log in to the AWS Portal.
2. Click **IAM** then click **Users**.
3. Select your user and click **Create Access Key**. If the user is
   not present on the AWS portal,  then, select the option **Add User** and
   select **Programmatic access** which will generate the **Access Key ID** and
   the **Access Key Secret**.

Profiling/Sampling
------------------

The service account should have SELECT grants on the Hive tables to
profile.
