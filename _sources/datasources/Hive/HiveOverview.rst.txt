Hive Overview
=================

Hive databases can be deployed on different platforms with various
execution engines in the middle layer, and as a result, there can exist
numerous Hive configurations. Alation is working toward supporting any
Hive setup with as little configuration effort on the user’s part as
possible.

How you can connect to a Hive data source in Alation, depends on which
Alation release you are using.

In releases before *V R5 (5.9.x)*, you can configure your Hive data
sources by providing connection parameters manually in Alation UI.

Starting with release *V R5 (5.9.x)*, you can connect to a
Hive database by uploading its client configuration files. Configuration
upload-based Hive connection is a **Labs/Feature Configuration** feature and must be enabled
through the dedicated feature switch in **Admin Settings** > **Labs/Feature Configuration**. Configuration upload-based Hive framework
specifically focuses on Query Log Ingestion (QLI) for Hive, allowing
Alation to support QLI for a bigger number of various Hive setups.

.. note::

    The Hive documentation refers to the configuration-based Hive framework, available from release
    V R5, as "Hive by configurations upload" or "configuration-based Hive". The Hive framework that is available by default and existed before V R5 is referred to as the "default Hive framework" or "default Hive".

If you enable Hive by configuration upload (V R5+), all existing Hive
sources  previously added using the default framework will
remain fully functional. Only the new Hive sources you add will require
the configurations to be uploaded. You can choose to migrate your existing default Hive sources to the new Hive
framework after you have enabled this feature.

Default Vs. Configuration-Based Hive Frameworks
-----------------------------------------------

The default Hive support covers:

============================= ================ =============== ================ ===============


With the configuration-based Hive, the level of support increases to:

============================= ================ ================ ================ ===============

Limitations
-----------

The Compose tool does not support Keytab or pre-cached Kerberos ticket-based authentication.

Which Hive Framework Should you Use?
------------------------------------

Analyze your Hive setup. If your Hive database setup is supported with
the configuration-based Hive framework only (for example,HDP 3 + Hive 3
+ Tez) but cannot be supported by the default Hive, the Hive by
configuration upload is the only path to choose.

If your Hive setup can be supported by both, default and
configuration-based frameworks, note that the configuration-based
Hive has several advantages configuration-wise:

-  It requires fewer parameters to be provided in Alation UI. For
   example, you will not need to find out from your Hadoop admin and
   manually type such information as the Metastore URI, log storage
   paths, and WebHDFS credentials and endpoints for QLI. This
   information will be obtained by Alation automatically when parsing
   the uploaded Hive configuration files.
-  The configuration-based framework is designed to fix any Hive
   cataloging problems that the old framework did not anticipate, so it
   significantly increases the chances of your Hive source working on
   the first try.


.. important::

    Several  Hive setups only use the default Hive framework for
    QLI. These are:

          -  SparkSql over Hive Metastore (on both CDH and HDP)
          -  Hive on EMR with QLI over Amazon S3
          -  Hive with AWS Glue as Metastore

    If you have such sources, do NOT enable configuration-based Hive.
