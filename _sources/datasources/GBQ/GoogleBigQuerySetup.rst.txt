When the Wizard is complete, run Metadata Extraction, Profiling, and Query Log Ingestion on the respective tabs of the **Settings** page.

Settings Page
-----------------

General Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **General Settings** page allows you to validate the connection, and
upload a new service account certificate or a user account certificate:

.. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ08.png
    :width: 5.5in

On the **General Settings** page, DO NOT change the
values ``bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com;`` and ``QueryDialect=SQL;`` or
profiling will fail:

Include the *Timeout=<Timeout_Value>* parameter in the above URI to increase the timeout if large datasets have to be extracted.

.. note::

   If the user account certificate has not been uploaded, you will not be
   able to query the source in Compose: there will be an authentication
   error from GCP when you try to connect to your GCP source.

   To resolve this, upload the User Account Certificate on the **General
   Settings** tab. This needs to be a user account that has access to the
   Project you want to query.

Metadata Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To extract metadata, go to the **Metadata Extraction** tab. Follow the prompts on this tab to perform MDE.

Note that when you do **Fetch Schemas**, Alation will fetch datasets from **all** the projects the user or service account used for authentication has access to in GCP.

The extracted metadata of Google BigQuery data source constitutes metadata of projects, datasets, tables and views, and columns of tables and views.  From 2021.3,
materialized views will also be extracted during MDE. Lineage is not supported for materialized views.


.. note::

    The STRUCT data type is supported from *version 2020.3*.

    From  2022.1, the description of the STRUCT data type will be extracted from the source comments during the metadata extraction and added to the Description field on the Catalog pages of column objects.

Default Metadata Extraction for Google BigQuery extracts only the SELECT queries from view definitions. To extract complete view definitions for Google BigQuery views and materialized views, perform additional configuration on the Alation server using **alation_conf** and setting the feature flag *enable_extraction_of_full_view_definition_for_gbq* to True. Refer to :doc:`Extract the Complete View Definition <../../admins/AdditionalConfiguration/ExtracttheCompleteViewDefinitionforGoogleBigQuery>` for more details.

.. Important::

    The user or service account used for MDE requires access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables in the Google BigQuery data source to extract complete view definitions. This operation adds to the cost of MDE, refer to `Information Schema Pricing <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#pricing>`_ in BigQuery documentation.

**Limitations of Metadata Extraction**:

#. You cannot perform the Include and Exclude extraction operation at the same time.
#. You cannot perform extraction of a schema if the schema name begins with an underscore.
#. Alation does not extract descriptions of schemas and tables.

Data Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the **Data Profiling** tab to perform profiling. Alation supports table and
column profiling. Standard SQL is used for profiling and supported by
the Simba driver.

Alation does not support profiling for partition tables and column
profiling for the Geography data type.

Query Log Ingestion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sampling in Query Log Ingestion** is not supported for the Google BigQuery data source type. **Sampling in Query Log Ingestion** flag must be off when you perform Query Log Ingestion. Make sure that the flag is off in **General Settings > Sampling in Query Log Ingestion**.

.. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ18.png

Go to the **Query Log Ingestion** tab to perform query log ingestion.QLI is supported for Popularity, top users, Lineage, and surfacing the Filters and Joins information.

Setting up Database Authentication in Compose
-----------------------------------------------

Authentication for Compose uses the **user account** and goes using the Simba driver. This connection uses the OAuth certificate uploaded to Alation when the data source was configured.  The OAuth certificate uploaded in the **User Account** section of the data source **Settings** > **General Settings**.

.. note::

   If the user account certificate has not been uploaded, this will result
   in an authentication error in Compose. To resolve this, upload a user account certificate on the **General Settings** tab of the data source Settings page (this requires the *Data Source Admin* level access to the data source). Refresh the Compose page.

Every user will have to establish a connection to GBQ with their own Google credentials when they use Compose for the first time. However, in the GBQ query history, all Compose queries will be logged as run by the main user whose OAuth certificate is provided in the data source Settings even though individual Compose users authenticate in Compose using their own Google credentials. Individual query history will be available in Alation, but not in GBQ query log.

Ensure that you use the correct configuration for Compose URI:

   -  DO NOT change ``bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com``
   -  ProjectId=<Project ID> where <Project ID> is the Project ID of a
      billing-enabled Project.

Your default connection URL will look like this:

      **bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2:443;ProjectId=my-project-for-gbq-source;QueryDialect=SQL;**

The default connection uses the Standard SQL parameter. See `Using Standard or Legacy SQL`_ below.

To connect in Compose,

#. Select the connection you want to use:

2.  Click the **Refresh** connection button for the selected connection:

    .. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ13.png
        :width: 5.5in

3. In the Google Authorization dialog that opens, click **Authorize**:

    .. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ14.png
        :width: 300px

4. On the next screen, choose the account you want to authorize with then click **Allow**:

    .. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ15.png
        :width: 300px

5. Upon successful authentication with Google, an authorization code will be displayed. Copy and paste this code from the Google authentication window into the **Code** field in the Database Authentication window in Alation Compose and click **Connect**:

    .. image:: ../../_static/DS_GBQ16.png
        :width: 300px

Note that if you receive errors when trying to authorize with Google, it may be:

-  **404 error - page not found** see :ref:`Page Not Found (404) when authorizing with Google <Google_BigQuery_Troubleshooting-404>`.
-  **The app not verified by Google error** see :ref:`An authentication error when connecting in Compose <Google_BigQuery_Troubleshooting-Auth_Error>`.

Starting with *V R6 (5.10.x)*, users can execute concurrent queries on Google BigQuery source.

Using Standard or Legacy SQL
-----------------------------

Starting with V R6, Alation supports both Standard and Legacy SQL for
GBQ data sources. You need to manually define the syntax you want to use
in the Connection URI in Compose.

To define the syntax, change the parameter **QueryDialect** in the
Compose connection URI: ``QueryDialect=SQL`` or ``QueryDialect=BIG_QUERY``. Refresh the Compose page and reconnect.

URI Example:

**bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2:443;ProjectId=my-project-for-gbq-source;QueryDialect=SQL;**
