Google BigQuery
==============================

.. important::

      Starting **August 30, 2023**, we will remove the ability to create new data sources using the Google BigQuery Native Connector. Support for the Google BigQuery Native Connector will cease on **December 1, 2023**, as set out in Alationâ€™s `Support Policy <https://www.alation.com/tscs/support/>`_. See the `Transition from Native to OCF Connectors <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/blogs/diby-malakar/2023/07/12/transition-from-native-to-ocf-connectors>`_ announcement in Alation Community (requires login to Community).

If you are using Google BigQuery as a data source, this section describes the prerequisites, authentication, and account setup steps needed to access the data source.

Alation uses a Google-authorized driver developed by Simba Technologies to connect to Google BigQuery data sources.
