Google BigQuery FAQ
=======================

How to allow Compose to query across projects?
-------------------------------------------------

Compose uses user account authentication. Because a Compose user authenticates using email, the email address should have access to all projects. Using IAM roles and the userâ€™s email addresses for projects, the Compose user is provided access to query across projects.

How does a user run concurrent queries in Compose for Google BigQuery?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the user account gets authenticated using the OAuth certificate,
the same user can run concurrent queries on Compose for Google BigQuery
as a data source. This feature is supported from Alation V R6 (5.10.x) release.
