Enable Salesforce Data Source Support
----------------------------------------

To turn on support for Salesforce data sources, enable the corresponding feature flag in Admin Settings > **Labs/Feature Configuration**:

    - **Enable SFDC Database Type**: enables support for SFDC (Salesforce) as a database type when adding a new data source.

Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

Prerequisites
-----------------

Creation of a Connected App in Salesforce is a prerequisite to connect Salesforce to Alation.

Connected Apps allow external applications to connect to Salesforce
over Identity and other DATA APIs. Such apps utilize the standard OAuth
2.0 protocol and  can provide Single Sign-On and acquire access tokens
for use by the Salesforce supported APIs. To connect your app to
Salesforce, follow the instructions as listed in `Auth0 documentation <https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/salesforce>`_.
After the connected app is created, go to **App Manager** -> Your connected
app -> **Manage** -> **Edit policies**. Update the **IP Relaxation** settings to **Relax
IP restrictions**. Select the option **Relax IP restrictions** to turn off the
IP restrictions to enable the connected app to connect to Salesforce:
