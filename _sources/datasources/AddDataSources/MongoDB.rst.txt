MongoDB
==========

*Available from Alation V R4 (5.8.0+)*

MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a
document-oriented database model to support various forms of data.

.. note::

    Ensure that the feature flag ``enable_generic_nosql_support`` is
    set to ``True``. If the feature flag is not turned on, MongoDB will not be displayed in the
    drop-down list of Database Types. This will not allow you to add the data
    source.
    You can set the feature flag ``alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_nosql_support``
    using ``alation_conf``. To set the feature flag, you need ``sudo`` access to the
    Alation host.

    1. On the host, enter the Alation shell and enable the flag:

      .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell
        alation_conf
        alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_nosql_support -s True

    2. Restart Supervisor:

      .. code-block:: bash

        alation_supervisor restart web:uwsgi celery:*

MongoDB as Custom DB
----------------------

Starting from V R7 (5.12.x), MongoDB version 4.2 is supported as Custom DB source type with the CData driver.

MongoDB Using Built-in Connector
-----------------------------------

This section describes how to configure a MongoDB data source using the built-in MongoDB connector.

Required Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure MongoDB in Alation, you will need the following information:

-  Hostname

    -  For the Kerberized environment, the hostname must be a fully qualified domain name.

-  Port number
-  Auth Source: This is required only for non-Kerberized environments
-  Service account with the following privileges:

    -  Root/Admin Access to the MongoDB cluster
    -  Alation provides three types of Authentication for MongoDB:

            - Basic Authentication
            - Kerberos Authentication
            - Starting with *V R7 (5.12.x)*, non-authenticated connection

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Confirm that Alation can reach the default port (or the configured port)
for the MongoDB service. The default port is **27017**.

URI
^^^^^

URI-based connection is supported where connection properties are
passed as parameters. For more information on connection string format,
see this `MongoDB article <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/>`_.

Select the checkbox **Enter URI** to add URI details.

Examples:

``mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017/admin``

``mongodb://server.example.com/?ssl=true&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB``

Service Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the service account for MongoDB based on basic or Kerberos authentication:

Basic Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the following example for creating a MongoDB user:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        db.createUser(
            {
             user: "mongouser",
             roles: [ { role: "root", db: "admin" } ]
           }
          )

.. note::

    As shown in the code snippet, if the DBA has the role of root,
    access to all databases is automatically provided. If the role is other
    than the root, make sure that you have the ``listDatabases`` privilege.
    Refer to the corresponding `MongoDB documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/>`_.

Kerberos Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 See the following example for creating a MongoDB user:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        db.createUser(
            {
             user: "mongouser/instance@REALM.COM",
              roles: [ { role: "root", db: "$external" } ]
            }
          )

To perform metadata extraction, service account must have root access.
If the DBA does not have root access, a role with ``listDatabases`` privilege must be provided.

Non-Authenticated Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with *V R7 (5.12.x)*, to establish a non-authenticated connection, as the service account **Username** in Alation, type one or several spaces. If **Username** is spaces and does not include any other characters, the non-authenticated connection will be established.

Using Kerberos for MongoDB V R4 (5.9.x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keytab is not supported. To configure Kerberos authentication for MongoDB,

#. Follow the instructions for :doc:`Configuring Kerberos for Data Source Authentication <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/ConfiguringKerberosforDataSourceAuthentication>`.
#. Inside the Alation shell, create the **kerberos.conf** file in the following location: **/data1/site_data/kerberos.conf**

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd /data1/site_data/
        sudo vi kerberos.conf

    The file should have the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

        primaryLoginContext {
            com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
            };

3. Append security information to the ``taskserver.extra_flags`` value in ``alation_conf``.

    Check the contents of the  field: ``alation_conf taskserver.extra_flags``. If this field has any value, you will want to avoid overwriting. Copy the existing values to a separate file and append the additional content before setting.

    Otherwise, set the ``taskserver.extra_flags`` as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

                alation_conf taskserver.extra_flags -s " -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/data1/site_data/kerberos.conf -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false"

4. Restart Taskserver:

      .. code-block:: bash

            alation_supervisor restart java:*


Using Kerberos for MongoDB from V R5 (5.10.x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For *V R5 (5.9.x)*, follow the instructions as listed in  for :doc:`Configuring Kerberos for Data Source Authentication <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/ConfiguringKerberosforDataSourceAuthentication>`.

Auth Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Auth Source is the name of a MongoDB database where the user credentials
are stored. The user credentials of the existing signed-in user are
taken into account. MongoDB credentials can be stored in any database.
``admin`` is the default name of the Auth Source. However, you can choose
to create the name of the Auth source other than ``admin``. These
credentials must be provided during the time of sign-in.

SSL
~~~~~~~
Select the checkbox **Server uses SSL** to include SSL information. To
install a CA certificate on Alation, follow the steps in the
section :doc:`Installing Certificates for Secure Data Source Connections <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/InstallingCertificatesforSecureDataSourceCon>`.

Metadata Extraction
-------------------------

Metadata extraction requires access to:

#. ``listDatabases``: Root access should be provided. If root access is not provided, ``listDatabases`` access must be provided. For more information on ``listDatabases``, refer to `this article <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/>`_.

#. Read access must be provided to each database that needs to be extracted.

The extraction condition including Exclusion and Inclusion filters along
with the extraction schedule and results of prior runs can be seen on the
**Metadata Extraction** tab.

Extract all objects except condition serves as the condition for
exclusion filter and extract only these objects (inclusion filter).
Select the appropriate option from the drop-down list and click **Run Extraction Now** button to perform metadata extraction.
