DB2 LUW
======= 

.. important::

      Starting **August 30, 2023**, we will remove the ability to create new data sources using the DB2 Native Connector. Support for the DB2 Native Connector will cease on **December 1, 2023**, as set out in Alation’s `Support Policy <https://www.alation.com/tscs/support/>`_. See the `Transition from Native to OCF Connectors <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/blogs/diby-malakar/2023/07/12/transition-from-native-to-ocf-connectors>`_ announcement in Alation Community (requires login to Community).

Required Information
--------------------------

To configure DB2 in Alation, you will need the following information:

-  Hostname or IP address of your server
-  Port number
-  Database Name
-  Service account with privileges listed below
-  Query Log Ingestion setup

Preliminaries
---------------

Firewall Configuration:

-  Open outbound TCP port **50000**

Create Service Account
----------------------

The DB2 service account is a Linux account. The account is created,
authorities need to be granted to the new user.

Sample commands to create the account:

.. code-block:: bash

     group -g 999 db2iadm1

     useradd -u 1004 -g db2iadm1 -m -d /home/alation alation

     password alation

Sample SQL to grant authorities to the account:

.. code-block:: sql

    -- SQL: enable new user to connect to database;
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE TO alation;
    -- This grants \`alation\` access to all data
    GRANT DATAACCESS ON DATABASE TO alation;

Metadata Extraction
-------------------

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.ROLEAUTH TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.TABAUTH TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.ROLES TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.DBAUTH TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.SCHEMAAUTH TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.COLUMNS TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.TABLES TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.REFERENCES TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.KEYCOLUSE TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.INDEXES TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSROUTINEPARMS TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.ROUTINES TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.VIEWS TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON SYSCAT.SCHEMATA TO alation;

Table Profiling
---------------

Permissions granted at account creation are sufficient to allow table
profiling.

Additional Setup:  Enabling Explain in Compose
----------------------------------------------

To support the Explain feature for DB2 connections, we need to follow
the steps below on your DB2 system. This a one-time process.

#. Connect to the DB2 instance

    .. code-block:: sql

        CONNECT TO database-name

2. Run the procedure given below

    .. code-block:: sql

        CALL SYSPROC.SYSINSTALLOBJECTS('EXPLAIN', 'C', CAST (NULL AS VARCHAR(128)), CAST (NULL AS VARCHAR(128)))

Query History
-------------

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE EVENT MONITOR alationQueryLogMonitor FOR STATEMENTS WRITE TO TABLE connheader(
      TABLE alationDb2QueryLogger.connection_header INCLUDES(sequence_no, auth_id, appl_id, conn_time)
    ),
    stmt(
      TABLE alationDb2QueryLogger.statement INCLUDES(
        appl_id,
        stmt_operation,
        stmt_text,
        start_time,
        stop_time,
        system_cpu_time,
        user_cpu_time
      )
    )
    MANUALSTART BUFFERSIZE 512 NONBLOCKED;
    SET EVENT MONITOR alationQueryLogMonitor STATE = 1;
    GRANT SELECT ON alationDb2QueryLogger.statement TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON alationDb2QueryLogger.connection_header TO alation;
