    GRANT SHOW VIEW ON [database].* TO 'alation'@'%';

Query History
---------------

Supported for MySQL 5.1.6 and higher. MySQL ``slow_log`` system table is
used to get query history. The recommended procedure is to enable
``slow_log`` on MySQL and to periodically flush ``slow_log`` into an archive
table. Alation will read queries from the archive table.

Slow Query Log adds some performance overhead and is only recommended
for OLAP environments where the queries are infrequent and are mostly
for analytical purposes.

To enable Slow Query Log, run the following queries as an admin user.

.. code-block:: bash

    SET GLOBAL slow_query_log=1;
    SET GLOBAL log_output='TABLE';
    SET long_query_time=0;
    SET min_examined_row_limit=0;

.. note::

   -  Slow Query Log can only be truncated and rows cannot be deleted.
   -  Administrative queries and queries not using indices are not logged by default.
