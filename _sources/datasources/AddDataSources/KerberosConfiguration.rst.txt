Kerberos Configuration (General)
================================

Kerberos needs to be configured to access Kerberized databases from
Alation. Follow the below steps to configure Kerberos.

-  Edit ``etc/krb5.conf`` inside the Alation Shell. (From outside the
   Alation shell, the path to the file is
   /opt/alation/alation/etc/krb5.conf.)  Make sure that Default Realm,
   Domain-To-Realm map, KDC for the Realm are defined.
-  Run ``kinit`` followed by ``kvno`` to verify your changes. Provide
   the Database Service Principal name as the argument for kvno.
-  Commit the changes into Alation Conf by running ``alation_action copy_krb5_conf``.

Run the below command to view the currently saved version of ``krb5.conf`` in Alation Conf.
