MemSQL
=========

.. important::

      Starting **August 30, 2023**, we will remove the ability to create new data sources using the MemSQL Native Connector. Support for the MemSQL Native Connector will cease on **December 1, 2023**, as set out in Alation’s `Support Policy <https://www.alation.com/tscs/support/>`_. See the `Transition from Native to OCF Connectors <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/blogs/diby-malakar/2023/07/12/transition-from-native-to-ocf-connectors>`_ announcement in Alation Community (requires login to Community).

Required Information
----------------------

To configure MemSQL in Alation, you will need the following information:

-  Hostname or IP address of your server
-  Port number
-  Service account with privileges listed below

Preliminaries
---------------

Firewall Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open outbound TCP port **3306** to MemSQL server

Enable MemSQL Flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable MemSQL flag in Alation shell, refer to :doc:`Feature Flags For Data Sources <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/FeatureFlags>`.

.. code-block:: bash

      alation.feature_flags.enable_datasource_memsql

Service Account
-------------------

Sample SQL to create an account

    .. code-block:: bash

        CREATE USER ‘alation’@’%’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘[password]’;

Permissions
---------------

Metadata Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. code-block:: bash

        GRANT SELECT ON [database].* TO ‘alation’@’%’;
        GRANT SHOW VIEW ON [database].* TO 'alation'@'%';

Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  .. code-block:: bash

      GRANT SELECT ON [database].* TO ‘alation’@’%’;
      GRANT SHOW VIEW ON [database].* TO 'alation'@'%';

Steps In Alation
-------------------

Step 1: Add a Datasource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new Datasource on the Sources page, refer to :doc:`Adding a Data Source </datasources/DSConfiguration/AddingaDataSource>`.

Step 2: Set up the Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a MemSQL data source to Alation; On the Add a Data Source screen of the wizard, specify:

      - In the **Database Type** list select **MemSQL**;
      - In the **Host** field, provide the hostname or IP address of your server.
      - In the **Port** field, type the port number 3306;
      - Under **Catalog**, provide the Title, Description, and Privacy settings, and click **Save and Continue**. The next wizard screen - **Set Up a Service Account** - will open.

Step 3: Enter Service Account Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Select **Yes**.

    #. Provide the username and password of the service account created for Alation.

    #. Click **Save and Continue**. After this step, you are navigated to the **Settings** page of your data source.

Metadata Extraction
-----------------------

**To perform regular MDE,**

    1. On the Metadata Extraction tab, click Fetch from DB Now. Alation will fetch schemas from your data source.

    2. You can now extract the metadata for all the schemas that Alation fetched (full extraction) or you can specify the schemas to be extracted from the list of fetched schemas   (selective extraction). To perform full extraction, click **Launch Job**. To perform selective extraction, first, select the schemas you wish to extract, and then click **Launch Job**:

    3. Once MDE has been completed, you should be able to see the extracted metadata in your Alation catalog. You can monitor the job status in the **Job History** table at the bottom of the page:

Profiling
-----------

Perform Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure and perform Profiling (optional) and verify the results. Set the number of tables to be profiled by the Profiling job by selecting a value in the dropdown list on top of the Job History table. By default, **all tables** are profiled. When a specific number of tables to profile is selected, unprofiled and popular tables are prioritized.

Click **Launch Job Now** to perform profiling.

**Automatic full and selective Profiling** is supported. You can run a profile for one table or column on the **Samples** tab of the Table or Column page of this data source or use the **Per-Object Parameters** tab to specify which objects to profile.

.. note::

      To profile a table during automatic Profiling, Alation issues a simple query for each table: SELECT * FROM <table>.  Please note that from a cost perspective you may want to profile specific tables only and/or set a schedule to profile weekly or even monthly.


Query Log Ingestion

Not supported.
