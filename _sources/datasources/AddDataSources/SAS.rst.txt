SAS
======

.. important::

      Starting **August 30, 2023**, we will remove the ability to create new data sources using the SAS Native Connector. Support for the SAS Native Connector will cease on **December 1, 2023**, as set out in Alation’s `Support Policy <https://www.alation.com/tscs/support/>`_. See the `Transition from Native to OCF Connectors <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/blogs/diby-malakar/2023/07/12/transition-from-native-to-ocf-connectors>`_ announcement in Alation Community (requires login to Community).

Required Information
-----------------------

To configure SAS in Alation, you will need the following information:

-  Hostname or IP address of your server
-  Port: **8591**
-  Service account with privileges listed below

Preliminaries
-----------------

Firewall Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open outbound TCP port **8591** to SAS Workspace server.

SAS Workspace Server should be installed on your SAS server and Alation
should be able to connect to the SAS Workspace Server.

Enable SAS Flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable SAS flag in Alation shell, refer to :doc:`Feature Flags For Data Sources <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/FeatureFlags>`.

.. code-block:: bash

      alation.feature_flags.enable_datasource_sas


Create Service Account
------------------------

You will need to create an account on the SAS Workspace Server that
supports host authentication. On how to define host-authenticated users, see, for example, `Connecting to a Remote SAS Workspace Server Using SAS Objects <https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=oledbpr&docsetTarget=p0q8ub3bquskwtn1i78gyhinmx9s.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en>`_ in SAS documentation.

Metadata Extraction and Table Profiles
------------------------------------------

You will need to allocate the Base SAS Library to the SAS WorkSpace
Server using the SAS Management Console. Instructions on allocation can
be
found at `Allocate Libraries via SAS Management Console <https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/emxndg/67980/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p15m68fofeq4imn1jmsgmg8xp7xp.htm>`_.
