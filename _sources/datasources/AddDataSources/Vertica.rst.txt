Preliminaries
-------------------

Firewall Configuration:

-  Open outbound TCP port **5433** to Vertica server

Create Service Account
-------------------------

Sample SQL to create an account:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE USER alation IDENTIFIED BY [password];

Metadata Extraction
-----------------------

Alation requires USAGE on all schemas that it will ingest and SELECT on
all tables that it will ingest.

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ONPROJECTIONS TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON PROJECTION_STORAGE TO alation;

Table Profiles
-------------------

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA [schema] TO alation;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA [schema] TO alation;

Query History
------------------

Vertica by default logs queries to some system tables. However, only an
admin account can select rows from these tables that have other users
queries. For Alation to ingest the queries you must either give
Alation admin credentials or create an ETL process to move the data into
another table that Alation can access. See Appendix A.5 Vertica Query Log for the SQL to create this table and move the
queries into it.
