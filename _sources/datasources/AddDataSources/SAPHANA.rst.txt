SAP Hana
============

.. important::

      Starting **August 30, 2023**, we will remove the ability to create new data sources using the SAP Hana Native Connector. Support for the SAP Hana Native Connector will cease on **December 1, 2023**, as set out in Alation’s `Support Policy <https://www.alation.com/tscs/support/>`_. See the `Transition from Native to OCF Connectors <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/blogs/diby-malakar/2023/07/12/transition-from-native-to-ocf-connectors>`_ announcement in Alation Community (requires login to Community).

Required Information
------------------------

To configure SAP Hana in Alation, you will need the following information:

-  Hostname or IP address of your server
-  Port number
-  Service account with privileges listed below
-  Query Log Ingestion setup: Expensive Statements Trace

Preliminaries
--------------------

Firewall Configuration:

-  Open outbound TCP port **30015**

Create Service Account
--------------------------

This account is used for extraction from SYS tables (``alation`` and ``password`` are for reference):

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE USER alation PASSWORD password;

Metadata Extraction
-----------------------

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT CATALOG READ TO alation;   --- read system views

The following views will be queried by the Alation service account during the Metadata Extraction process:

-  VIEWS
-  TABLES
-  M_TABLES
-  SYNONYMS
-  INDEX_COLUMNS
-  TABLE_COLUMNS
-  INDEXES
-  INDEX_COLUMNS
-  FUNCTIONS
-  FUNCTION_PARAMETERS
-  AFL_FUNCTIONS
-  AFL_FUNCTION_PARAMETERS
-  PROCEDURES
-  PROCEDURE_PARAMETERS
-  REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS

Calculation View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SAP HANA view is used to select data, analyze data, or perform
calculations with data from the SAP HANA database. The types of view are
Attribute view, Analytic view, and Calculation View. The calculation
view is a powerful and flexible information view, which is used to
define advanced logic or complex calculations on the tables or
information views available in SAP HANA. Calculation views can be
created in two ways: Graphical or SQL Script.
To enable Alation to extract metadata (Lineage, view definition SQL)
from Calculation View, manually run metadata extraction on ``_SYS_BIC`` schema.
**Alation can only extract metadata of "graphical" calculation
view**.

.. note::

   The data source administrator will need to always provide an include
   list and must include ``_SYS_BIC`` to extract Calculated Views. The **Include**
   list will look something like: schema1, schema2, _SYS_BIC

Table Profiling
-----------------

Run for all schemas:

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA  [schema] TO alation;

Or run for all tables in all schemas:

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ON [schema].[table] TO alation;

Query History
------------------

Query History logs are read from the **Expensive Statements Trace**. The
Expensive Statements Trace is off by default; for information on
activation and configuration options, refer to the corresponding `SAP HANA help center article <https://help.sap.com/doc/6b94445c94ae495c83a19646e7c3fd56/2.0.00/en-US/5faf04f17830464eacdb7938b383d2ab.html>`_.

To enable Alation to read logs:

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ON "SYS"."M_EXPENSIVE_STATEMENTS" TO alation;
