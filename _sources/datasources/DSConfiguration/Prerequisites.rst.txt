Prerequisites
====================

Alation requires a DB service account to read the following information:

-  DB Metadata
-  Table samples
-  Query History Logs

*Query Log Ingestion* enables Alation to Â compute object usage and popularity,
common query expressions and filters, and user expertise. It is
recommended to enable query logging two weeks before installation if
it is not enabled already.

Automated daily Query Log ingestion typically reads from a table, view,
or source file system (depending on the database type). Ideally, queries
executed in the last seven days can be read. If the daily query volume is large
(more than a million/day) or if the DB server is constrained by disk
space, a minimum of last three days worth of logs is required.

In environments where historical Query Log for a week or longer is
available, the historical log can be ingested into Alation.

The sections that follow describe permissions and setup required for
connecting data sources to Alation and ingesting metadata, samples, and
query logs.
