Add Data Sources
=====================================================================

You can add new data sources to the Alation catalog on
the :doc:`Sources <../../sources/CatalogSources/SourcesPage>` page. 

Prerequisites to Add a Data Source
------------------------------------

- If applicable to the specific database type, the required feature flag is enabled
- **Server Admin** role in Alation
- A service account for the data source
- Privileges for the service account to retrieve metadata, profile
  data, and retrieve query history information
- Specific setup on the database side for Query Log Ingestion (QLI)

Note that prerequisites will differ depending on the database type. For
some types, you may need to perform several preliminary steps on the
database side. This article describes a generic scenario of adding a
data source. For details about each specific supported DB type, refer
to the respective section of the documentation.

Add a Data Source
--------------------

To add a data source,

1. Sign in to Alation as a Server Admin. 
2. Click the **Sources** icon on the main toolbar to open the Sources page:

      :width: 5.5in
      :align: center

3. Click the **Add** icon on the upper right:

      :width: 5.5in
      :align: center

4. In the list that opens, click **Data Source**. This will bring up the **Add a Data Source** wizard:

      :width: 3.5in
      :align: center

5. Specify the **Title**.

6. The user setting up a data source is automatically assigned as a *Data Source Admin* to this source. To assign additional Data Source Admins, hover over **Assign Data Source Admins** section to reveal the **Add** icon on the right. Click **Add** to find and add users:

      :width: 3.5in
      :align: center

7. Select an option under **Who is setting this up?**

    -  **I’m setting up this Data Source** you will be able to continue to
       the next step.
    -  **Ask the Data Source Admins to complete this setup** the wizard will
       close and the data source admins you have added will be notified. The
       data source will be added with the incomplete setup. You can finish
       the setup under **Sources > Data Sources > Manage Settings**.

8. If you have chosen the option **I’m setting up this Data Source**, click **Continue Setup**. This brings up the next step of the Add a Data Source wizard where you will specify the connection parameters:

        :width: 3.5in
        :align: center

9. Select the database type from the **Database Type** dropdown list.
 
10. Enter the required information, such as **Host**, **Port**, **Database Name**, and other details. These fields will vary depending on the database type you have selected.

11. From the **Privacy** list, select the Privacy value. Privacy settings define access to the data source in the Alation catalog. Select **Public** if you want everyone in the organization to see this data source in the catalog; or select **Private** to restrict access to specific Viewers and Data Source Admins.

12. Click **Save and Continue**. The **Service Account** wizard screen will open. A service account is required to establish connection to the database to extract metadata, profile the data, ingest query history, and generate previews of tables:

        :align: center

13. On the Service Account screen, select **Yes** or **No** depending on the service account availability. We recommend that you create a service account for Alation before adding the source. If you do not have a service account, you can create it now, although this will require that you run a query against the database then return to Alation and confirm that you have created the account.

14. If you have chosen **Yes**, then enter the **Username** and **Password** of the service account.

15. If you have chosen **No**, then specify the **Username** and **Password** for the new account. When you do that, Alation will display the query you will need to run on the database to create the account with the required permissions. You can reveal the permission information by clicking **Show permissions information** under the query:

        :align: center

16. After running the query, return to Alation and select the checkbox **The Service Account is created** to confirm that you have created the account.

17. Click **Save and Continue**. This will bring up the Query Log Ingestion (QLI) setup screen:

  .. image:: ../../_static/Screen_Shot_2019-11-07_at_11.17.28_PM.png
        :width: 3.5in
        :align: center

18. You can skip this step and address QLI setup later on the **Query Log Ingestion** tab of the data source Settings page. For some data sources, Alation recommends skipping this step. To skip, click **Skip this Step**.

19. If you choose not to skip this step, provide the required information and finish setup.

Your data source will be added to Alation and you will land on its
settings page. You can now provide additional settings (they will vary
depending on the database type) and perform metadata extraction,
profiling, and QLI.

Continue With Errors
----------------------

During setup, you can override errors by clicking **Continue with Errors**.
You will be able to add your data source but will need to troubleshoot
the errors on the Settings page to be able to establish
connection and run the data jobs:

Finish Later
--------------

In the Add Data Source wizard, you can save your data source with an
incomplete setup by clicking **Finish Later**:

    :align: center

Data Sources with incomplete setup can be located under **Sources >
Data Sources > Manage Settings**. *Data Source Admins* can
complete setup later where it was left off. 

Discard
---------

If you want to drop the setup, in the wizard, click **Discard**:

This will cancel the setup, and the data source will not be added.
