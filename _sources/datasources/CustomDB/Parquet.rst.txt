Parquet (Amazon S3)
========================

*Applies from 2021.3*

Alation has certified the Parquet files on Amazon S3 data source with the following CData driver:

  - cdata.jdbc.parquet.ParquetDriver.cdata.jdbc.Parquet

The driver reads the metadata from Parquet files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and extracts them as tables. The different files in the S3 bucket are extracted as individual tables in Alation.

Alation can provide the required CData driver license for Parquet. Refer to :doc:`How to get a CData Driver <../../datasources/CustomDB/CDataDrivers>` and use the scenario appropriate to your case.

Required Information
---------------------------

  - JDBC URI for the Parquet (Amazon S3) data source

JDBC URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When building the URI, include the following minimal list of required parameters:

    - **AWSAccessKey** - AWS account access key that is available on AWS security credentials page.
    - **AWSSecretKey** - AWS secret key that is available on AWS security credentials page.
    - **URI** - URI of the Amazon S3 bucket where the Parquet resources are located.
    - **IncludeSubdirectories** - Whether to read files from nested folders. In the case of a name collision, table names are prefixed by the underscore-separated folder names. Set the **IncludeSubdirectories** to **True**.
    - **RTK Key** - when you purchase a CData driver from Alation, you are provided an RTK that needs to be included into the URI. If you purchased the driver from CData, you should have a license file that needs to be placed on the Alation server together with the driver .jar file.

Below are the list of optional parameters that can be either included in the **URI** or in the **Properties** field on the **General Settings** page if required:

    - **ProxyServer** - The hostname or IP address of a proxy to route HTTP traffic through.
    - **ProxyPort** (If proxy connection is used) - The TCP port the ProxyServer proxy is running on.

Use the following format for the JDBC URI:

.. code-block:: Bash

      parquet://AWSAccessKey=<awsaccesskey>;AWSSecretKey=<awssecretkey>;URI=<S3Bucket_URI>;IncludeSubdirectories>=True;RTK=<RTK_Key>

Example:

.. code-block:: Bash

      parquet://AWSAccessKey=AKIATEIZM7LWKA2ZLJEZ;AWSSecretKey=LG8en7gyGQfJqrMA4izWJ0G7vkvT0Yqv/xGwdh;URI=<S3Bucket_URI>;IncludeSubdirectories=True;RTK=444752465641535552425641454E545042424D33323632390000000000000000000000000000414C5800005559475655474E4E464242370000

Use the following format for the JDBC URI if proxy connection is used:

.. code-block:: Bash

      parquet://AWSAccessKey=<awsaccesskey>;AWSSecretKey=<awssecretkey>;URI=<S3Bucket_URI>;ProxyServer="<ProxyServer_HostName>";ProxyPort="8866";ProxySSLType="NEVER‚Äù;IncludeSubdirectories=True;RTK=<RTK_Key>

Example:

.. code-block:: Bash

      parquet://AWSAccessKey=AKIATEIZM7LWKA2ZLJEZ;AWSSecretKey=LG8en7gyGQfJqrMA4izWJ0G7vkvT0Yqv/xGwdh;URI=<S3Bucket_URI>;ProxyServer="Localhost";ProxyPort="8866";ProxySSLType="NEVER";IncludeSubdirectories=True;RTK=444752465641535552425641454E545042424D33323632390000000000000000000000000000414C5800005559475655474E4E464242370000

Set Up in Alation
-----------------------

Step 1: Add the CData Driver for Parquet to Alation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on how you purchased the CData driver, from Alation or from CData, the driver installation process will be different. Refer to :doc:`Add the CData Driver into Alation Instance <../../datasources/CustomDB/CDataDrivers>` and use the scenario appropriate to your case.

STEP 2: Add a New Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new Data Source on the Sources page.

Step 3: Set up the Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. On the **Add a Data Source** screen of the wizard, specify:

      - **Database Type:** Custom DB
      - **JDBC URI:** URI in the required format. See `JDBC URI`_.
      - **Select Driver:** select the JDBC driver for Parquet from the Select Driver drop-down list:

        **cdata.jdbc.parquet.ParquetDriver.cdata.jdbc.Parquet**

      - Do not select the **Use Kerberos** checkbox

 2. Click **Save and Continue**. The next wizard screen - **Set Up a Service Account** - will open.

        :class: with-border

Step 4: Enter Service Account Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Select **Yes**.
  2. Provide the username and password of the service account created for Alation.
  3. Click **Save and Continue**. The next wizard screen, **Configure Your Data Source**, will open.

Step 5: Configure Your Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click **Skip this Step**. After this step, you are navigated to the **Settings** page of your data source.

General Settings
----------------------

Once you successfully create the connection, you will land on the **General Settings** page.

.. note::

      If you click the **Test** button under **Network Connection**, an error message **Data Source URI has no host specified** will appear instead of the connection test status. Please disregard this message. This is currently expected behavior.

Metadata Extraction
--------------------------

Configure and perform metadata extraction and verify the results:

  - In **Settings > Custom Settings**, set the **Catalog Object Definition** to **Catalog.Schema.Table**:

    .. image:: ../../_static/Parquet_02.png
        :width: 600px
        :class: with-border

  - In **Settings > Metadata Extraction**, set up and perform MDE. Refer to :doc:`Metadata Extraction <MDEFromCustomDB>`.

Profiling
---------------

Configure and perform :doc:`Sampling and Profiling <ProfilingForCustomDB>`:

    - Users can run a sample for an individual table on the **Samples** tab of the Table Catalog page or profile an individual column on the **Overview** tab of the Column page.
    - Automatic full and selective Profiling is supported.
    - Use the **Per-Object Parameters** tab of the Settings to specify which objects to profile.

      .. note::

          Make sure that the **Skip Views** checkbox of the respective schemas is unchecked to perform the Profiling.

    - Custom query-based Sampling is supported. :ref:`Custom Query-Based Sampling <Sampling_Profiling-Custom_Query_Based_Sampling_for_Tables>` allows you to provide a custom query for profiling each specific table.
    - Deep Column Profiling (:ref:`Profiling V2 <profilingV2-label>` ) is supported.

Query Log Ingestion
------------------------

Not supported.

Compose
-----------

Log into Compose:

    - Authenticate in Compose with your Amazon S3 credentials.
    - Use the **Catalog.Schema.Table** format for writing queries.

Troubleshooting
-----------------

Logs to collect/review:

    - For logs related to MDE: **taskserver.log, taskserver_err.log**.
    - For logs related to Compose: **connector.log, connector_err.log**.
    - For any other errors: **alation-error.log, alation-debug.log**

To show driver activity from query execution to network traffic, use Logfile and Verbosity. At the end of the `JDBC URI`_, add Logfile=/tmp/log.file;Verbosity=3; which will generate the log file in the specified directory. Set the Verbosity level as required, refer to `Logging <https://cdn.cdata.com/help/SKG/jdbc/pg_advancedlogging.htm>`_.

Contact Alation support for help tracing the source of an error or to avoid a performance  issue. Following are the examples of common connection errors and show how to use these properties to get more context.

  - **Authentication Errors:** Recording a **Logfile** at **Verbosity 4** is necessary to get full details on an authentication error.
  - **Queries Time Out:** A server that takes too long to respond will exceed the driver's client-side timeout. Setting the **Timeout** property to a higher value will avoid the connection error. Also you can disable the timeout by setting the property to 0 and setting the **Verbosity** to 2  will show where the time is spent.
  - **The certificate presented by the server cannot be validated:** This error indicates that the  driver cannot validate the server's certificate through the chain of trust. If you are using a self signed certificate, there is only one certificate in the chain.

   To resolve this error, you must verify yourself that the certificate can be trusted and specify to  the driver that you trust the certificate. One way you can specify that you trust a certificate is  to add the certificate to the trusted system store; another is to set **SSLServerCert**.
