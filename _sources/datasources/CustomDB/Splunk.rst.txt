Splunk
============

*Applies from 2021.3*

Alation has certified the Splunk data source with the following CData driver to support additional features:

  - cdata.jdbc.splunk.SplunkDriver.cdata.jdbc.splunk

Alation can provide the above mentioned CData driver license for Splunk. Refer to :doc:`How to get a CData Driver <../../datasources/CustomDB/CDataDrivers>` and use the scenario appropriate to your case.

Scope of Support
---------------------

    - Supported as Custom DB with the CData Driver for Splunk.
    - Metadata Extraction (MDE)

        - Automated MDE

    - Compose
    - Data Profiling
    - QLI is not supported

Ports
---------

Port 8089 must be open.

Service Account
-------------------

Create the service account for Splunk, refer to `Create a User <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/8.2.2106/Security/Addandeditusers>`_. Make sure that the user has the Admin role assigned.

Required Information
-----------------------

    - JDBC driver used to connect to the database: CData JDBC Driver for Splunk
    - JDBC URI for the Splunk data source

JDBC URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When building the URI, include the following components:

    - User
    - Password
    - Port Number
    - Instance URL
    - RTK Key - when you purchase a CData driver from Alation, you are provided an RTK that needs to be included into the URI. If you purchased the driver from CData, you should have a license file that needs to be placed on the Alation server together with the driver .jar file.

Use the following format for the JDBC URI:

.. code-block:: Bash

      splunk://User=<Username_for_splunk>;Password=<Password_for_splunk>;SSLServerCert=*;AuthScheme=Basic; URL= <Instance>:<Port_Number>;RTK=<RTK_Key>

**Example:**

.. code-block:: Bash

      splunk://User=Admin;Password=Password;SSLServerCert=*;AuthScheme=Basic;URL= https://localhost:8089;RTK=444752465641535552425641454E545042424D333236323900000000000000000000000000000000414C4154494F4E5800005559475655474E4E464242370000

Limitation
--------------

Query Log Ingestion is not supported.

Set Up in Alation
-------------------

Step 1: Add the CData Driver for Splunk to Alation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on how you purchased the CData driver, from Alation or from CData, the driver installation process will be different. Refer to :doc:`Add the CData Driver into Alation Instance <../../datasources/CustomDB/CDataDrivers>` and use the scenario appropriate to your case.

STEP 2: Add a New Datasource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new Datasource on the Sources page.

Step 3: Set up the Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. On the **Add a Data Source** screen of the wizard, specify:

      - **Database Type:** Custom DB
      - **JDBC URI:** URI in the required format. See 'JDBC URI'_.
        *Example:*

        .. code-block:: Bash

              Marklogic://10.13.64.245;Port=8000;API=REST;User=UserName;Password=Password;UseSSL=True;SSLServerCERT=/tmp/certificate.crt;RTK=444752465641535552425641454E545042424D333236323900000000000000000000000000000000414C4154494F4E5800005559475655474E4E464242370000

      - Select Driver: select the JDBC driver for MarkLogic from the Select Driver drop-down list:

        **cdata.jdbc.splunk.SplunkDriver.cdata.jdbc.splunk**

      - Do not select the Kerberos **‘Use Kerberos’** checkbox.

2. Click **Save and Continue**. The next wizard screen - **Set Up a Service Account** - will open.

Step 4: Enter Service Account Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Select **Yes**.

2. Provide the username and password of the service account created for Alation.

3. Click **Save and Continue**. The next wizard screen, **Configure Your Data Source**, will open.

Step 5: Configure Your Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click **Skip this Step**. After this step, you are navigated to the **Settings** page of your data source.

Metadata Extraction
----------------------

Configure and perform metadata extraction and verify the results:

  - In **Settings > Custom Settings**, set the **Catalog Object Definition** to **Catalog.Schema.Table**:

    .. image:: ../../_static/Splunk_02.png

  - In **Settings > Metadata Extraction**, set up and perform MDE. Refer to Metadata Extraction.

Profiling
------------

Configure and perform :doc:`Sampling and Profiling <../../datasources/CustomDB/ProfilingForCustomDB>` :

    - Users can run a sample for an individual table on the **Samples** tab of the Table Catalog page or profile an individual column on the **Overview** tab of the Column page.
    - Automatic full and selective Profiling is supported.
    - Use the **Per-Object Parameters** tab of the Settings to specify which objects to profile.

      .. note::

          Make sure that the **Skip Views** checkbox of the respective schemas is unchecked to perform the Profiling.

    - Custom query-based Sampling is supported. :ref:`Custom Query-Based Sampling <Sampling_Profiling-Custom_Query_Based_Sampling_for_Tables>` allows you to provide a custom query for profiling each specific table.
    - Deep Column Profiling (:ref:`Profiling V2 <profilingV2-label>` ) is supported.

Query Log Ingestion
---------------------

Not supported.

Compose
---------

Log into Compose:

    - Authenticate compose with your Splunk credentials.
    - Use the **Catalog.Schema.Table** format for writing queries.

Troubleshooting
-----------------

Logs to collect/review:

    - For logs related to MDE: **taskserver.log, taskserver_err.log**.
    - For logs related to Compose: **connector.log, connector_err.log**.
    - For any other errors: **alation-error.log, alation-debug.log**
