QLI From Custom DB
===================

Alation supports several ways to perform QLI for Custom DB:

- :doc:`File-based QLI <../../datasources/CustomDB/FileBasedQLICustomDB>` (available from release V R5 (5.9.x))
- :doc:`Creation of QLI View <../../datasources/CustomDB/ViewBasedQLICustomDB>` (available from release V R4 (5.8.x))
- :doc:`SQL Query Execution <../../datasources/CustomDB/SQLQueryBasedQLICustomDB>` (available from release V R4 (5.8.x))

Scheduling QLI
---------------

After you have run QLI for the first time, you can schedule it to run on an auto-schedule. To schedule QLI,

#. In the **Automated Query Log Ingestion** section, clear the checkbox **Disable automatic query log ingestion**. This will reveal fields for setting the schedule:

        .. image:: ../../_static/DS_CustomDB22.png
            :width: 5.5in
            :align: center

2. Click each field to open the list of values as add a schedule for QLI:

        .. image:: ../../_static/DS_CustomDB22.png
            :width: 5.5in
            :align: center

The next QLI will run on the schedule you have provided. When QLI is scheduled, Alation will extract log information starting from the date of the latest QLI and ending with the current date.
