Alation Cloud Service Offerings
===============================

Alation Cloud Service (ACS) has several offerings to meet the needs of different organizations. All Alation Cloud Service options take advantage of our distributed, cloud-native architecture and provide enhanced performance, scalability, and security. The differences between the offerings are explained below.

- **Snowflake Partner Connect Free Trial**—Available through Snowflake’s Partner Connect portal, the free trial lets you try out Alation free for 14 days. The free trial offers Snowflake-specific data governance capabilities, in addition to many other standard features like the business glossary and intelligent SQL editor. You’ll also get self-guided tours and access to product specialists through a built-in chat.

- **Alation Cloud Service Enterprise Tiers**—Alation Cloud Service Enterprise has different tiers that are tailored to your organization’s workload. It offers access to the full suite of Alation features and allows you to connect to a variety of data sources beyond Snowflake. Additional users, connectors, and certain features are purchased separately so you can expand as needed.
