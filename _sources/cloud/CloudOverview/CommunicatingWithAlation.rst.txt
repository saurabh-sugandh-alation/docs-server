Communication between the Alation admins on the customer side and Alation happens using the Alation Service Cloud Portal.

If there is a specific request or need for assistance, a Server Admin should go to the `Alation Portal site <https://alation.force.com/>`__ and use the **Contact Alation Support** link to create a support ticket. Include the following prefix into the subject line: *Alation Cloud Service*.

Reasons to submit a ticket to the Alation team can include:

  - Experiencing an issue
  - Enabling an **alation_conf** setting
  - Performing a configuration on the server backend
  - Making an enhancement request
