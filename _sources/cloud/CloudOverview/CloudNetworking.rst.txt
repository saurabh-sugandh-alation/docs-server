Cloud Networking
==========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

The following network options are supported:

    - Whitelisting the Alation Cloud Service Internet Gateway on the corporate network (no additional cost)
    - Enhanced networking with AWS PrivateLink (priced separately)

Whitelisting the Alation Cloud Service Internet Gateway
-------------------------------------------------------

For those customers that support the whitelisting of the Alation Cloud Service NAT Gateway, Alation will send the NAT Gateway IP information. The IT team on the Customer side will need to whitelist the IP based on their network configuration.

For instructions, see :doc:`Whitelist the Alation Cloud Service IP <../../cloud/CloudConfiguration/WhitelistCloudServiceIP>`.

AWS PrivateLink
-------------------------------

Alation Cloud Service supports the AWS PrivateLink option that provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture.

For Alation Cloud Service customers on the cloud-native architecture, support for PrivateLink was added in the 2023.1.5.1 release.

For instructions, see :doc:`/cloud/CloudConfiguration/AWSPrivateLinkWithAlationCloudService`.
