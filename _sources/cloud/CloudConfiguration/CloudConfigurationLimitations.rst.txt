Cloud Service Configuration Limitations
============================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

Email Server Setup Limitation
---------------------------------------

Currently, the managed Cloud deployment of Alation does not support corporate email server setup. The built-in email server option has to be used until this functionality is added.

Alation Analytics V2 Limitations
----------------------------------------

Starting in 2023.3, Alation Cloud Service customers on the cloud native architecture can connect third-party BI tools to Alation Analytics V2.

If you are an Alation Cloud Service customer whoâ€™s not yet on the cloud native architecture, contact your account manager to discuss your options.

Leaderboards
-----------------------------

Leaderboards are by default turned off for Alation Cloud Service customers hosted in Europe. To have this feature turned on, create a Service Cloud ticket.

Custom Thumbnail Images on the Homepage
---------------------------------------------

If a Server Admin wants to use custom images on the Alation Homepage, they can do so using an Article object in Alation. On how to add custom images using an Article object, see :doc:`Use Custom Thumbnail Images </admins/CustomizableHomePage/CustomizeHomepage2023_3_4AndLater>`.

You can also contact Alation Support to request the addition of new images to your Alation instance.
