Agent Release Notes
===================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

See :ref:`Agent Compatibility Matrix` for information about which versions of Alation Cloud Service are supported by each version of the Agent. To get the latest Alation Agent features and fixes, we recommend :doc:`upgrading <UpgradingTheAgent>` to the latest version of the Alation Agent that’s compatible with your version of Alation Cloud Service.

Release 1.5.1.2863
------------------

Support for More Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alation Agent now officially supports more operating systems:

-  Debian 11
-  Red Hat 9
-  Ubuntu 22

For a complete list of supported operating systems, see the :ref:`Agent system requirements <Agent System Requirements>`.

Diagnostic Tool Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in :ref:`diagnostic tool <diagnose-agent-connectivity-problems>` now checks that **/etc/hosts** is configured correctly. A missing or incorrect **/etc/hosts** file can disrupt the connection between Alation Cloud Services and the Alation Agent.

Release 1.5.0.2541
------------------

Diagnostic Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Is your Agent in a disconnected state? We’ve added a new diagnostic tool to the Agent that will help you troubleshoot connectivity issues. See the :ref:`Troubleshooting <diagnose-agent-connectivity-problems>` topic for details on working with the diagnostic tool.

Release 1.3.0.1536
------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

We fixed an issue where the Agent was failing to close old network connections when establishing failover connections to Alation Cloud Service.

Release 1.2.1.1168
------------------

Improved Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alation Agent now establishes multiple failover connections to Alation Cloud Service for improved uptime and performance.

Support for Basic Authentication with Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Alation Agent now works with HTTP CONNECT proxies that require basic authentication. On the Agent machine, edit the **/etc/hydra/hydra.toml** file to include the following line:

.. code-block:: bash

   web_proxy = "<username>:<password>@<proxy-address>:<proxy-port>"

Replace the parts in angle brackets with the appropriate information for your proxy.

See the :ref:`Agent installation instructions <Agent Configure Proxy>` for more details on configuring the Agent to work with a proxy.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

We fixed an issue where the Agent could sometimes report an ERROR.E1000, which would prevent connectors from being installed. Upgrading to version 1.2.1.1168 resolves this issue.

Release 1.2.1.1120
------------------

Compose Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Aalation Agent now supports Compose connections to on-premise data sources. This support includes:

- Query execution in Compose
- Query forms
- Scheduled queries
- Excel live reports
- Data upload

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-agent-compose-support
   :end-before: .. end-agent-compose-support

Release 1.2.1.868
-----------------

Multiple Agent Installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation now supports multiple Alation Agent installations per cloud instance. Multiple Agents may be required if data sources are in different geographical locations, network segments, or security zones. A Server Admin for a cloud instance can now install Alation Agent multiple times to enable connection to on-premise data sources from the catalog.

Agent Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Users can now delete an Agent even when the certificate is revoked.

- The default port of **80** for ``web_proxy`` is now honored by the Agent. Previously port **80** was incorrectly ignored and defaulted to **3128**.
