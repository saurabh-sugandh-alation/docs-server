Connect the Agent to Data Sources
====================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

To connect to a data source with the Alation Agent (Agent), you must first install the appropriate OCF connector on the Agent. To obtain an OCF connector, open a support ticket with Alation to request the specific OCF connectors you need.

.. important::

   -  The Agent only works with connectors based on the :doc:`Open Connector Framework </sources/OpenConnectorFramework/OCFOverview>` (OCF).

   -  The Agent only supports RDBMS and BI connectors.

Once you’ve installed the right connector, you can add the data source.

Install a Connector on the Agent
-----------------------------------

You must be a Server Admin to install the connector. Each connector is installed in its own container on the Agent machine.

To install a connector on the Agent:

1. Get the appropriate OCF connector from Alation support. The connector will be provided as a Zip file.

2. In Alation, click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner. This opens the **Admin Settings** page.

3. Under the **Server Admin** section, click **Manage Connectors**.

4. Click the **Install New Connector** button on the **Connectors Dashboard** page.

7. Drag and drop the connector Zip file into the designated area, or click in the area to select the file from your system.

   .. note::

      The installation may take several minutes. When it’s done, a success message will appear.

   .. note::

      If you get an error, see the :doc:`Troubleshooting </cloud/AlationAgent/TroubleshootingTheAgent>` page.

8. When the installation is complete, click the **Close** button.

   The list of connectors will refresh. After a moment, your new connector will appear in the list. The Agent’s name will be added to the end of the connector name.

Connect to a Data Source through the Agent
---------------------------------------------

Once you’ve installed the right connector on the Agent, you can connect to an on-premise data source from Alation through your Agent.

The process of adding an on-premise data source through the Agent is almost the same as adding any other data source. The difference is that when choosing the **Database Type**, you must choose an OCF connector that shows the Agent’s name in parentheses.

The pattern for OCF connector names is “<Data Source> OCF Connector (Agent Name).” For example, if you wanted to connect to a MySQL data source on an agent named “Agent,” you would select “MySQL OCF Connector (Agent)” for the **Database Type**. The connector will have the same name that appears in the Connectors Dashboard.

Once you select the **Database Type**, the dialog will close and take you to the **Datasource Settings** page. There you can enter the connection information for your on-premise data source.

Once you have connected to the data source, you can run metadata extraction, query log ingestion, sampling, and profiling.
