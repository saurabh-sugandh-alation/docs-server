Start and Stop the Agent
===============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

On the Agent’s host machine, you can start and stop the Agent if desired. The commands to start and stop the Agent affect all of the Agent’s :ref:`components <Agent Architecture>` together—the reverse proxy, the Alation Connection Manager, and the connectors.

Before starting or stopping the Agent, you may want to :ref:`check the Agent’s status <Check Agent Status>` first.

Stop the Agent
------------------

To stop a running Agent:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo hydra stop

Once the Agent has stopped, it will appear as disconnected on the **Agents Dashboard** in Alation. Running sudo docker ps on the Agent machine will show no active containers.

Start the Agent
------------------

To start a stopped Agent:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo hydra start

Restart the Agent
--------------------

To restart the Agent (stop and then automatically restart again):

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo hydra restart
