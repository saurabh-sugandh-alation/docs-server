Uninstall and Reinstall the Agent Software
================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

Uninstall the Agent
----------------------

To uninstall an Agent from your network, run the following commands on the Agent’s host machine.

Red Hat-Based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run these two commands in turn.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum remove alation-container-service

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum remove alation-hydra

Debian-Based
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run these two commands in turn.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get remove alation-hydra

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get remove alation-container-service

Or run these two commands in turn.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dpkg --remove alation-hydra

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dpkg --remove alation-container-service

After you uninstall an Agent, the corresponding Agent entry on the **Agents Dashboard** in Alation will show as disconnected. To delete the Agent entry from the **Agents Dashboard**, see :ref:`Deleting the Agent from Alation <Delete Agent>`. To reinstall an Agent on your network and connect it to an existing Agent entry in Alation, see below.

Reinstall an Agent and Reconnect to Alation
-------------------------------------------------

In some cases, you may have an Agent listed on the Agents Dashboard in Alation, but the Agent software that you had installed inside your network is no longer there. For example, the Agent’s host machine may have gone down, or the Agent software may have been uninstalled or deleted.

If this happens, you can install a new copy of the Agent on your network and reconnect it to the Agent entry in Alation. Once the connection has been restored, any connectors you had previously installed on your old Agent will automatically be reinstalled on the new Agent.

Step 1: Prepare for the Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can install the Agent, you must:

1. Provision a Linux host to install the Agent on. This can be a physical or virtual machine. Do not run other software on this machine—only the Agent should be installed. See :ref:`Agent System Requirements` for details.

2. Get access to Alation’s Customer Portal. If you don’t have access or aren’t sure how to access it, contact your account manager.

3. Have the Server Admin role in Alation.

Step 2: Navigate to the Agent Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First ensure you have completed the prerequisites in the prior step. You must have the Server Admin role in Alation to complete the remaining steps.

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard
   :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-new-agent-button
      :end-before: .. end-click-new-agent-button

   .. note::

      You will only need to use the first step in the **Add New Agent** process. This provides you the information needed to install the Agent. Do not click the **Next** button.

Step 3: Download and Run Installation Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-link-to-portal
      :end-before: .. end-click-link-to-portal

2. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-select-agent-download
      :end-before: .. end-select-agent-download

3. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-transfer-installation-file
      :end-before: .. end-transfer-installation-file

      :end-before: .. end-extract-installation-file

5. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-change-into-ocf-agent-dir
      :end-before: .. end-change-into-ocf-agent-dir

6. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-copy-installation-command
      :end-before: .. end-copy-installation-command

7. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-run-installation-command
      :end-before: .. end-run-installation-command

8. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-optional-proxy-setup
      :end-before: .. end-optional-proxy-setup

9. In Alation, click the **X** button to exit the **Add New Agent** dialog.

   .. note::

      Do not click the **Next** button. The remaining steps in the **Add New Agent** process are not needed in this scenario.

Advanced Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-configure-proxy
   :end-before: .. end-configure-proxy

Step 4. Renew the Agent’s Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re reinstalling the Agent on the same machine as your old Agent, you may be able to reuse the old Agent’s certificates. To check if your old Agent’s certificates are still valid, see :ref:`Viewing the Certificates Expiration Date`. If they are not valid, or if you’re installing the Agent on a new machine, use the steps below to renew the certificates.

1. On the **Agents Dashboard** in Alation, click the name of the Agent you are reconnecting to.

2. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-renew-certificate
      :end-before: .. end-renew-certificate

3. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-generate-certificate-request
      :end-before: .. end-generate-certificate-request

   .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-existing-certificate
      :end-before: .. end-existing-certificate

   .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-output-of-request
      :end-before: .. end-output-of-request

4. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-copy-certificate-request
      :end-before: .. end-copy-certificate-request

5. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-paste-certificate-request
      :end-before: .. end-paste-certificate-request

6. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-copy-certificate-installation-command
      :end-before: .. end-copy-certificate-installation-command

7. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-paste-certificate-installation-command
      :end-before: .. end-paste-certificate-installation-command

8. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-restart-agent
      :end-before: .. end-restart-agent

9. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-finish
      :end-before: .. end-click-finish

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-certificate-expiration-note
   :end-before: .. end-certificate-expiration-note

Step 5. Resync the Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your new Agent installation should now be connected to your Alation Cloud instance. Now you can resync the Agent, which will reinstall any connectors that you had previously installed on your Agent.

1. On the Agent page, click the **Agent Options** button, then select **Resync Agent**.

   .. image:: ../../_static/Agent_Options_ResyncAgent.png

2. A confirmation message will appear. Click the **Confirm** button to continue resyncing.

3. The resync process may take some time. When the resync is complete, a success message will appear. Click the **Close** button.

   .. image:: ../../_static/Agent_ResyncComplete_Close.png
      :class: with-border

Step 6. Verify the Data Source Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the Agent has been resynced, you can verify that the Agent’s data source is connected properly. To do this, you must be a Data Source Admin for this data source.

1. Go to **Apps** and select **Sources**.

2. Click the data source you want to verify.

3. Click on **More**, then **Settings**.

4. Click on the **General Settings** tab.

5. Under the **Network Connection** heading, click the **Test** button.
