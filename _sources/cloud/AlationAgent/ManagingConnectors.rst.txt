Connectors that are installed on the Alation Agent can be managed using the **Connectors Dashboard**. This is the same as other OCF connectors.

To navigate to the **Connectors Dashboard**:

1. In Alation, click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner. This opens the **Admin Settings** page.

2. Under the **Server Admin** section, click **Manage Connectors**.

3. Click the **Actions** button to view the list of actions available for an installed OCF connector. The actions are described below.
