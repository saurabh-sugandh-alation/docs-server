.. _Delete Agent:

Delete the Agent from Alation
-------------------------------

You can delete an Agent from the Agents Dashboard in Alation at any time. This will have the following effects:

-  The Agent is removed from your Agents Dashboard in Alation.

-  All connectors you have installed on the Agent will be deleted from the Agent. The data sources will still appear in Alation, but the connection to your physical data source will be broken. You’ll no longer be able to use the old data source in Alation to conduct metadata extraction or other operations. If you reinstall the connector, you can add the data source to Alation again, but it will be considered a separate data source from the old one. You will have to rerun metadata extraction again on this new data source.

-  The certificate for the Agent is revoked. The connection is broken between your Alation Cloud instance and the Agent software installed on your network.

-  The Agent software remains on the host machine where you installed it (unless it has been removed or uninstalled separately). You can :ref:`reconnect <reconnect agent>` it later, if desired.

To delete an Agent from Alation:

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard
   :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-agent-name
      :end-before: .. end-click-agent-name

#. Click the **Agent Options** button, then select **Delete Agent**. A confirmation message appears.

#. Click the **Confirm** button to delete the Agent. A success message appears.

#. Click the **Close** button. You will be returned to the Agents Dashboard. The Agent will no longer be listed.

The Agent software that you installed on your network is unaffected by this procedure, but it will now be unable to connect to your Alation Cloud instance. To reconnect your Agent to your Alation Cloud instance, see `Reconnect an Installed Agent to Alation`_. To uninstall the Agent from your network, see :doc:`UninstallingAndReinstallingTheAgentSoftware`.

.. _reconnect agent:

Reconnect an Installed Agent to Alation
------------------------------------------

If you have deleted an Agent from the Agent Dashboard in Alation and the Agent software is still running on your network, you can reconnect the installed Agent to your Alation Cloud instance. Before reconnecting the Agent, check the :ref:`Agent Compatibility Matrix` to see if a newer Agent is available for your Alation Cloud version. If so, upgrade the Agent first.

Step 1: Navigate to the Agent Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have the Server Admin role in Alation to complete these steps.

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard
   :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard

4. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-new-agent-button
      :end-before: .. end-click-new-agent-button

5. Click the **Next** button.

   .. important::

      Do not follow the installation instructions on the **Install Agent** screen. You do not need to install the Agent again, because it’s already installed and running on your network.

Step 2: Name Your Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-name-the-agent
   :end-before: .. end-name-the-agent

Step 3: Generate Encryption Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-certificate-intro
   :end-before: .. end-certificate-intro

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-generate-certificate-request
      :end-before: .. end-generate-certificate-request

   .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-existing-certificate
