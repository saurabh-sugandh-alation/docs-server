Work with the Agent’s Certificates
=====================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

Alation uses signed certificates to encrypt the communication between your Alation Cloud instance and the Agent. Alation uses two signed certificates—one for the Agent and one root certificate. These certificates will automatically expire after one year.

You’re in full control of these certificates. You can always view the certificates in Alation. You can revoke them at any time to stop communication between your Alation Cloud instance and the Agent. You can also renew certificates at any time, whether they are current, expired, or revoked.

.. _Navigate to Agents Dashboard:

To work with the Agent’s certificates, first navigate to the Agents Dashboard:

.. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
   :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard
   :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard

.. _Viewing the Certificates Expiration Date:

View the Certificates’ Expiration Date
-----------------------------------------

To view the expiration date of the Agent’s certificates:

1. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard-reference
      :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard-reference

2. In the **Certificate Expiration** column, you can see the date on which the certificates will expire. If there is no date, then there are no valid certificates associated with that Agent.

      See `Renew the Certificates`_ to reestablish the connection.

5. Click the **Close** button to exit the dialog.

Revoke the Certificates
-------------------------

You can revoke the Agent’s certificates at any time. This stops all communication between the Agent and your Alation Cloud instance.

To revoke an Agent’s certificates:

1. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-navigate-to-agents-dashboard-reference
      :end-before: .. end-navigate-to-agents-dashboard-reference

2. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-click-agent-name
      :end-before: .. end-click-agent-name

3. Click the **Agent Options** button, then select **Revoke Certificate**.

   .. image:: ../../_static/Agent_Options_RevokeCertificate.png

4. A confirmation dialog appears. Click the **Confirm** button to revoke the certificate.

   .. important::

      It may take up to an hour before the certificate is fully revoked, per the Online Certificate Status Protocol (RFC 5019) Section 6. Your Agent may appear to have a **Connected** status until that time.

.. _Renewing Agent Certificates:

Renew the Certificates
-------------------------

Agent certificates automatically expire after one year. You’ll need to renew them on a yearly basis in order to keep using the Agent. You may also need to renew certificates that you have previously revoked.
