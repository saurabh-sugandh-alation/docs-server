Upgrade the Agent
===================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

To upgrade an Alation Agent (Agent) installation to a newer version:

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
         :start-after: .. start-check-agent-version
         :end-before: .. end-check-agent-version

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-go-to-customer-portal
      :end-before: .. end-go-to-customer-portal

#. If a newer version of the Agent is available in the **Version** column of the Alation Customer Portal, proceed with the upgrade.

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-select-agent-download
      :end-before: .. end-select-agent-download

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-transfer-installation-file
      :end-before: .. end-transfer-installation-file

   .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-old-ocf-dir-warning
      :end-before: .. end-old-ocf-dir-warning

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-extract-installation-file
      :end-before: .. end-extract-installation-file

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-change-into-ocf-agent-dir
      :end-before: .. end-change-into-ocf-agent-dir

   Then check the name of the installation file.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ls

   It should be named something like **ocf-agent-<version>.deb** or **ocf-agent-<version>.rpm**.

#. Run one of the following commands, replacing “<agent-install-file>” with the file name of the Agent installer you downloaded.

   On a Debian-based machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo dpkg --install <agent-install-file>

   On a Red Hat-based machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo rpm -Uvh <agent-install-file>

#. If you're upgrading the Agent as part of an upgrade to Alation 2022.4 running on Alation's cloud native architecture, you may also need to update the Agent configuration file. See :doc:`/cloud/AlationAgent/UpdateAgentDnsAddress`.

#. .. include:: ../../shared/Agent_TextFragments.rst
      :start-after: .. start-restart-agent
      :end-before: .. end-restart-agent

   The upgrade process is complete when the Agent is done restarting.

#. Verify the upgraded Agent’s version by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      hydra version

   The version number will be in the first line of the output.
