Status Page 
==================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

.. important:: 

    The **Status Page** applies only to customers on the Cloud Native Architecture. 

    The **Status Page** displays the status by region for all the tier-one shared services. If there is an issue that impacts only an individual customer, the status will not be reflected on the public page

The Alation Cloud Service (ACS) **Status Page** is where you can get real-time information and updates about ACS. The Status Page 
enables you and anyone else at your organization to self-serve when you need to understand any issues that may arise. With the 
Status Page, anyone at your organization can subscribe to updates or visit the website so you can directly get more information without 
having to open a support ticket. If you ever experience an issue with your ACS instance, the Status Page can be checked first to see if 
there are any known issues affecting customers. Specifically, you can check the status of ACS by region and subscribe to notifications for incidents.

Navigate to the Status Page with this URL: `<https://status.alationcloud.com/>`_. 

The information provided on the Status Page can help you plan any further actions. You can always contact Alation Support for more help. 

Subscribe to Updates
----------------------

When you subscribe to updates, you will be notified about events without having to visit the Status Page directly. You can receive status notifications of an issue affecting your service’s region. You can subscribe to updates through email or email and Slack.

Click the **Subscribe to Updates** button in the upper right and fill in the relevant information to receive notifications.

Best Practice When Subscribing to Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to review carefully and only select the relevant service(s) that you want to receive updates on. There is one service per region so you will 
want to select the region that your ACS instance is hosted in. This will ensure that you only receive updates that are relevant to your ACS instance and do not receive updates regarding regions where you are not using Alation.

Subscribe to Email Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notifications are sent directly to your inbox when you subscribe to email updates. 

1. Click the **Subscribe to Updates** button in the upper right. 
2. In the dialog under the Email tab, type in your email address
3. Click the dropdown to choose the region where your ACS instance is hosted. 
    * The default location shows as **All Services**. 
    * Select the region your ACS instance is in. This will remove All Services and replace it with only the region you have selected.
    * If needed, you can also add additional regions or remove regions. 
4. Click the **Subscribe Email** button to receive updates about ACS.

    * The incident status (Detected, Investigating, or Resolved) 
    * The time the message was posted 
    * Actions being taken

You may also see information on how long until the next update. 

Within the post, the **View incident details** button takes you to a separate page to view the timeline of the issue. You can click the **Send me updates** button to receive updates via email for that specific incident. 

.. note:: 
    
    If you are already subscribed to your service region, you will automatically receive notices about specific incidents. You will not get notifications about impacts in other regions.

View Incident Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once an incident is resolved, the Status Page reverts back to display a green check mark. If you are subscribed to updates, a Resolved notification is sent to your email.

You can view the history and details of a specific incident, such as when it was detected and when it was resolved. Click the **History** button in the lower-right under **System Status** to view the incident timeline.
