Tableau Troubleshooting Tips
=================================

Migrating to Tableau 10.5
----------------------------

Moving to version 10.5 can cause the following error in older versions of Alation: ``column u_table.admin_level does not exist``

To fix the issue follow these steps:

1. Connect to the Alation shell:

   .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo service alation shell

2. Enter the Django shell:

   .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_django_shell

3. Run the following commands. The ID can be obtained in the Alation UI from the URL of the source:

   .. code-block:: Bash

        ts = TableauServer.objects.get(id=<id_of_server>) 
        ts.permission_model=2
        ts.save()

Using an AD Account
--------------------------

There is a known issue where if an AD is used for the Tableau Server
account, and that account needs to be entered with the AD Realm
information (for example: ``XX\acct_name``), then you may see extraction fail.

The workaround for this is to change the following ``alation_conf`` value:

.. code-block:: Bash

   alation_conf tableau.extraction.pg_filter_sites_by_server_account -s False
