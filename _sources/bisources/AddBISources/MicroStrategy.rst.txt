MicroStrategy
=================

MicroStrategy as a BI source option is available in Alation by default. In releases prior to *version 2020.3*, no additional configuration is required to add MicroStrategy sources to the Catalog.

In version 2020.3 and newer versions, before adding a MicroStrategy BI source, enable the Generic BI Model V2 (GBM V2) for MicroStrategy sources by setting the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation.feature_flags.enable_mstr_for_gbm_v2`` to ``True``.

+------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| Feature Flag                                   |  Should be       |
+================================================+==================+
|                                                | True             |
| alation.feature_flags.enable_mstr_for_gbm_v2   |                  |
|                                                | (Default: False) |

Generic BI Model V2 for MicroStrategy Sources
-----------------------------------------------

*Applies from release 2020.3*

The **Generic BI Model V2** (GBM V2) is an improved framework for cataloging BI Server sources that is intended to provide more features and a better catalog user experience. From version 2020.3, new MicroStrategy server sources should be added to Alation using GBM V2.

    .. note::

        Note that after upgrading to version 2020.3 from previous releases, all MicroStrategy sources previously added on the Default BI framework remain fully functional. You can choose to migrate them to GBM V2. See `Migrate a MicroStrategy Source Data to GBM V2 Framework`_ below.

MicroStrategy sources on Default framework and on GBM V2 can be differentiated with their URLs:

- ``https://<your_alation_URL>/bi/gbm/server/1/`` - the Default GBM framework
- ``https://<your_alation_URL>/bi/v2/server/2/`` - the GBM V2 framework


Extraction From a MicroStrategy Source
---------------------------------------------

From version 2021.1.3, Alation uses MicroStrategy REST APIs available in the MicroStrategy Library in addition to MicroStrategy WebSDK and URL API to extract metadata from the Intelligence Server. As the result of extraction, the following MicroStrategy objects will be catalogued:

    - Projects
    - Published Cubes as Datasources

        .. note::

            Alation does not extract:

                - Unpublished Cubes and data objects built on unpublished Cubes
                - Datasource connection information

    - Attributes
    - Facts
    - Metrics
    - Prompted and unprompted Reports

        .. note::

            Alation user interface does not differentiate prompted and unprompted reports.

    - Dossiers
    - Documents
    - Report Attributes and Metrics
    - Preview images for Reports
    - User permissions information to enable Permission Mirroring

Permission Mirroring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Alation mirrors the object access permissions from MicroStrategy. This means that Alation users will only have access to those MicroStrategy objects in the Catalog that they are permitted to access on the Intelligence Server. Permission Mirroring can be disabled on the Settings page of the MicroStrategy source.

If Permission Mirroring is enabled, Alation will extract and store user permission information for each extracted metadata object. When an Alation user with a matching username accesses Catalog pages with MicroStrategy metadata, they will only see the objects they have permissions for on the Intelligence Server side. If the username of an Alation user does not match any username extracted from MicroStrategy, then this user will not be able to view extracted MicroStrategy objects in the Alation Catalog.

Preliminaries
----------------

The following information about your MicroStrategy server is required for the Alation Catalog:

Configuration information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Hostname or IP address of the MicroStrategy Intelligence Server
    - Port number (optional). Default is **34952**.
    - Service Account with the following permissions:

          - READ on Projects, Project Folders, Reports, and Dashboards that need to be extracted
          - EXECUTE on Reports and Dashboards
          - READ access to read user permissions (for Permissions Mirroring)
          - *From 2021.2*: READ access to Governing Limits on the Intelligence Server:

                - DssXmlServerProjectMaxJobPerUserAccount
                - DssXmlServerProjectMaxJobPerUserConnection
                - DssXmlServerProjectMaxJobPerProject

                Governing Limits are applied to limit the number of resources on the Intelligence Server that Alation will occupy during extraction

    - MicroStrategy version
    - Alation 2021.1.3 and newer releases: MicroStrategy Library must be enabled.

        - Library URL example: **http://10.13.44.54:8080/MicroStrategyLibrary** (do not use the trailing slash **/** at the end)

        .. note::

            To check that the MicroStrategy Library can be reached on your Intelligence Server, use the following URL: **<YOUR_MSTR_SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs**


Firewall Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open outbound TCP port to Intelligence Server, usually port **34952**.

#. Alation should be able to forward resolve (from hostname to IP) and reverse lookup (from IP to hostname) for the Intelligence Server. In other words, the following two commands should work inside the Alation Shell.

   -  ``nslookup [INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_HOSTNAME]``
   -  ``nslookup [INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]``

   If any of the above commands fail, add an entry in the **/etc/hosts**Â on
   the Alation Server (on the host, NOT on the Alation shell) as follows:

      - ``INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_HOSTNAME``

   .. note::

        Connectivity error information can be found in Taskserver logs at **/opt/alation/site/logs/taskserver.log** (path inside the Alation shell).

9. *From 2021.3:* Under **Application Settings**, select the **Disable Automatic Lineage Generation** checkbox to skip the creation of automatic Lineage after extraction. Click **Save**. When automatic Lineage generation is disabled, during extraction Alation does not calculate Lineage data for this BI source.

  For more information, see :doc:`Disable Automatic Lineage Generation FAQ <../../bisources/AddBISources/DisableAutomaticLineageGenerationFAQ>`.

10. Under **Test Connection**, click **Test** to verify that connection to the MicroStrategy server can be established.
11. If required, configure Selective Extraction. See `Selective Extraction From MicroStrategy`_.
12. If required, enable Automated Extraction under **Automated and Manual Extraction**: :ref:`Schedule Extraction <Extracting_BI_Server_Metadata-Schedule_Extraction>`.
13. Click **Run Extraction Now** to perform extraction.

Examples for the Custom Web Server Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. note::

        Add the **http://** or **https://** prefix at the beginning of the URL.

        Do NOT use a trailing slash â/â at the end of the Custom webserver URL. This will result in an erroneous link.

        Changes made to the **Custom web server** field take effect after the next extraction.

Let's assume that the value entered for the Custom web server is **http://10.13.22.232:8080**.

Then, if the Web server type is Java, MicroStrategy BI Source URL gets redirected to **http://10.13.22.232:8080/MicroStrategy/servlet/mstrWeb?**

A MicroStrategy Project URL gets redirected in the following way: **http://10.13.29.171:8080/MicroStrategy/servlet/mstrWeb??evt=3010&Project=MicroStrategy%20Tutorial**

A MicroStrategy Report URL gets redirected in the following way: **http://10.13.29.171:8080/MicroStrategy/servlet/mstrWeb?evt=4001&src=mstrWeb.4001&reportID=13CFD83A458A68655A13CBA8D7C62CD5&Project=MicroStrategy%20Tutorial**


Migrate a MicroStrategy Source Data to GBM V2 Framework
----------------------------------------------------------

*Applies from version 2020.3*

After the update to 2020.3, the existing MicroStrategy sources can be migrated to GBM V2. During the migration, all the objects under this source are converted to the GBM V2 object model. Alation object IDs of the BI server object and its child objects are preserved, and no duplicate objects are created.

To migrate your existing MicroStrategy source to GBM V2,

1. Enable GBM V2 for MicroStrategy on your Alation instance: from the Alation shell, use the **alation_conf** command to set the parameter ``alation.feature_flags.enable_mstr_for_gbm_v2`` to ``True``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell
        alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_mstr_for_gbm_v2 -s True
        alation_supervisor restart all

2. To migrate the source, still in the Alation shell, change user to ``alation``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo su alation

3. Run the one-off migration script, substituting the placeholder values with real values:

    - <MSTR_source_id> - the ID of the MicroStrategy source that is being migrated to GBM V2:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python opt/alation/django/rosemeta/one_off_scripts/copy_mstr_gbmv1_logical_data_to_gbmv2.pyc -s <MSTR_source_id> --confirm


    **Example**:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python opt/alation/django/rosemeta/one_off_scripts/copy_mstr_gbmv1_logical_data_to_gbmv2.pyc -s 1 --confirm

The migration moves the MicroStrategy BI source to the GBM V2 object model. All catalog data (field values, trust flags, stars, mentions) are preserved on the source as was.

.. note::

    After the migration has been completed, the URL of the migrated source will change from **<your_alation_URL>/bi/gbm/server/<id>** to **<your_alation_URL>/bi/v2/server/<id>**.

The source on GBM V2 will use BI object templates associated with GBM V2.

6. If required, turn on **Selective Extraction**. For details, see `Selective Extraction From MicroStrategy`_.

7. If required, enable **Automated Extraction** under **Automated and Manual Extraction**: :ref:`Schedule Extraction <Extracting_BI_Server_Metadata-Schedule_Extraction>`.

8. Click **Run Extraction Now** to perform extraction.

Selective Extraction From MicroStrategy
---------------------------------------------

In case you only need to catalog specific BI server objects (for example, specific Projects), toggle on the Selective Extraction option. After enabling it, select specific BI Projects to extract.

To configure selective extraction,

1. Toggle on the **Selective Extraction** switch under **Extraction Settings**. This will reveal more controls for this option.

    *Selective Extraction ON - Default framework*

    .. image:: ../../_static/bi_image32.png
        :width: 500px

    *Selective Extraction ON - GBM V2*

    .. image:: ../../_static/bi_image31.png
        :width: 500px

2. Click **Get List of Projects**. This action fetches the list of all projects from the BI server that you can extract into the catalog. This action is logged in the **Job Status** table at the bottom of the page.

    .. note::

        Extraction uses the Service Account credentials specified in the **Server Connection** section of the **Settings** page. Alation can only fetch the list of Projects this Service Account has been granted access to on the Intelligence Server side.


3. Refresh the page to see the list of Projects that were fetched from the BI server. The page refresh will enable the **Add** icon on the right that allows for selecting specific projects.

    .. image:: ../../_static/bi_image33.png
        :width: 500px

    .. note::

        The **Add** button for Selective Extraction will remain inactive if:

          - Permission Mirroring is enabled and the logged in Alation admin does not have their credentials mirrored in MicroStrategy
          - The logged in admin performing the extraction does not have access to any Projects fetched from MicroStrategy.

        In order to get the list of Projects, or perform a successful MDE, you can:

          - Create a user in MicroStrategy with credentials matching Alation adminâs credentials.
          - Disable Permission Mirroring by selecting the checkbox Disable Permission Enforcement under Additional Settings, save the configuration and refresh the page. Re-enable Permission Mirroring after extraction.

        If the Add button still remains inactive, check the Service Account permissions on the Intelligence server side.


4. Make sure the extraction filter is set to the desired value:

    - **All Projects except**: Alation will extract all projects except projects specified by name.
    - **Only these Projects**: Alation will only extract the projects specified by name.

5. Click the **Add** icon on the right and from the list of fetched Projects, select Projects to extract or to exclude from extraction, depending on the extraction filter value you have set. The Projects you have selected will appear under **Projects**.

7. *From version 2021.2* Select the checkbox **Remove Projects that are not captured by the list above** if you wish to hide from the Catalog the previously extracted Projects that are not selected for the current extraction.

8. Click **Run Extraction Now** to extract metadata.
