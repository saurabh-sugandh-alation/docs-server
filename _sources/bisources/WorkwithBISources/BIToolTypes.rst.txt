Types of BI Tools
=====================================================================

Alation integrates with BI tools in two distinct ways:

- first, Alation pushes your query results out to BI tools

- secondly, Alation ingests completed reports.  

For your query results, Alation integrates directly with Plot.ly and Tableau. You can download your results directly to either of these tools:

- :doc:`/analyst/WorkwithQueryResults/ExportAndDownloadQueryResults/ExportQueryResultsToPlotly`
- :doc:`/analyst/WorkwithQueryResults/ExportAndDownloadQueryResults/ExportQueryResultsToTableau`

If you build a report in MicroStrategy, Tableau, or your homegrown tool, Alation can ingest your reports nightly, enabling users to:

- :doc:`Find them using Alation Search </welcome/CatalogBasics/FullPageSearch>`
- :doc:`View the metadata </bisources/WorkwithBISources/ReportCatalogPage>`
- :doc:`Visualize the source data lineage </bisources/WorkwithBISources/FindSourceDataLineage>`.
