Set Permissions for Tableau Objects Flags
=====================================================================

*Available from V R5 (5.9.x)*

When the Generic model for Tableau server is enabled, you can set rules
on which groups of users can flag Tableau Server objects by applying
permissions to flags (Endorse - Warn - Deprecate) on BI server object
pages. You need the role of a *Catalog* or *Server Admin* to
work with field permissions. By default, everyone can set and remove the
Endorse - Warn - Deprecate flags on Tableau object pages.

To set permission on object flags,

1. Sign in to Alation and on the upper right of the main toolbar, click the **Settings** icon to open **Admin Settings**.
2. In the **Catalog Admin** section, click **Customize Catalog**. The Customize Catalog page opens.
3. Click **Custom Field Permissions** and on this tab, find the BI object fields you want to restrict with permissions. These fields are listed in the **Built-in Fields** table under the **Custom Fields** table.
4. For the desired flag field, click **Add Rule** and in the list of groups and people sets that open, select the required **groups** and/or **people sets**.

BI Objects Flags
----------------

=========================== ===================================================================================================
BI Server Flags             Permissions for this field apply to the Tableau Server page that uses the *BI server* template

BI Folder Flags             Permissions for this field apply to the Tableau pages that use the *BI Folder* template:
                            Site/Project/Workbook

BI Report Flags             Permissions for this field apply to Tableau objects that use the *BI Report* template: Views
                            (Dashboard and Report)

BI DataSource Flags         Permissions for this field apply to Tableau objects that use  the *BI Datasource* template:
                            Data Source

BI DataSource Column Flags  Permissions for this field apply to Tableau objects that use the *BI Datasource Column*
                            template: Data Source Columns (Measures and Dimensions)

BI Report Column Flags      Permissions for this field apply to Tableau objects that use the *BI Report Column* template:
                            Columns of Views (Measures and Dimensions in Reports and Dashboards)
=========================== ===================================================================================================

Note that these permissions cannot be individualized for a
specific Tableau object. If you set permissions on a flag for a specific
object type, these permissions apply to all objects of this
type. For example, if you have two Tableau sources in your catalog, and
then apply permissions to theÂ **BI Server Flags** field, this
restriction equally applies to both sources, and only the groups
or/and people sets you select in the rule can change the
flags on both these sources.

After you have added the rules to the fields, only the users who belong
to the selected groups and/or people sets see and can
change the flags on the Tableau object pages. Users who are not included
in the selected groups or sets do not see the object flags next to the
object title.

This functionality is only available for Tableau if you have
enabled the Tableau generic model feature. If you are using the legacy
Tableau model, any user can set or remove the **Endorse - Warn - Deprecate** flags on Tableau objects as field permissions do not apply to Tableau on the legacy framework.
