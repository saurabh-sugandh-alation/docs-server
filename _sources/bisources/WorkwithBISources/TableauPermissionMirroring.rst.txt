Tableau Permission Mirroring
=====================================================================

**Permission Mirroring** enables you to regulate view access to objects
in a Tableau source based on the same access rights that users have on
the Tableau server.

With Permission Mirroring enabled for your Tableau source, Alation will
only display those Tableau objects to a user which this user can see in
Tableau.

Permission mirroring:

-  Applies to sites, projects, workbooks, sheets, and datasources
-  Applies to all Alation users, including users with the Server Admin
   role

Example:

Tableau Site A has two projects, **Public** and **Private**. Project **Public** can be viewed by all users of Site A, but project **Private** is restricted to one user group and is only
visible to this group. User John Smith belongs to this group. User
Jane Brown does not.
In Alation, a server admin extracts both projects: **Site A/Public** and **Site A/Private**. When user John Smith logs in to Alation and opens the page of the Tableau source, he will be able to see and access the catalog pages of both projects, **Site A/Public** and **Site A/Private**, under this Tableau source.
When user Jane Brown logs in to Alation, she will only see the project **Site A/Public** but will not see **Site A/Private** because she does not have Tableau permissions to view it.

In release *V R5 (5.9.x)* and later, permission mirroring
is enabled by default. The parameter **Disable Permission
Enforcement** on the Tableau source settings page can be set to disable
it. When permission mirroring is disabled, Alation does not enforce
permission checks for extracted Tableau objects, and Alation users can
see all extracted metadata:

.. note::

    Release *V R5 (5.9.x)* and later releases have two frameworks for Tableau sources: Legacy and Generic. For details, see :doc:`Add Tableau Server as a BI Source <../../bisources/AddTableauServer/index>`. Both Legacy and Generic frameworks support permission mirroring for Tableau server version 2018.1. Sources for Tableau server versions 2018.3, 2019.1, 2019.2 must be added on the Generic framework if you intend to use permission mirroring. Alation recommends enabling the Generic framework for your Tableau sources because it offers more features and a more robust functionality.

Matching Tableau and Alation Users
----------------------------------

To enforce Tableau permissions, Alation has to "understand"
which Alation user is which user in Tableau. That is why, during
extraction Alation also calculates the Tableau - Alation user matches.

User matching  is based on **username** if the username of an Alation
user matches a username on the Tableau server, we consider them to
be the same. For permission mirroring to work, the expectation is that
the Tableau and Alation users have the same username in both these
systems. As an example, look at a user named John Smith. Assume that on the Tableau server, this person has a
username *jsmith@company.com*, but in Alation, he is added
as *john.smith@company.com*. When calculating user matches, Alation
will NOT be able to match these two usernames and associate them with
one user because they do not formally match. John Smith will not be able
to see any Tableau objects as Alation does not have his Tableau
permissions record. However, if this user is added
as *jsmith@company.com* to both Tableau and Alation, Alation will be
able to establish the match and permission mirroring will work: John
Smith will see those Tableau objects in Alation which he has permissions
to view on the Tableau server.

.. note::

    Alation - Tableau user matching is case-insensitive. This means that usernames *john.smith@company.com* and *John.Smith@company.com* will be matched as the same user.

Enabling permission mirroring makes the most sense when Alation and
Tableau are using the same authentication mechanism, for example LDAP
authentication with the same LDAP directory. If not, those users in
Alation who require access to a Tableau source, must be created with the
same usernames as in Tableau.

Extracting Tableau Objects With Permission Mirroring Enabled
------------------------------------------------------------

When enabled, permission mirroring will apply when:

-  you are fetching project information for your Alation source from the Tableau server;
-  you are running metadata extraction from Tableau;
-  after extraction, when you access the Tableau source and its child objects in the catalog.

.. note::

     You must be a *Server Admin* in Alation to access the settings of a BI source and to run extraction.
     Alation recommends that the Server Admin who configures a Tableau source in Alation has Tableau permissions to all Tableau objects that need to be cataloged in Alation. This will ensure that the admin will be able to see and extract all the Tableau objects that your users should be able to find the catalog.

Fetching Project Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fetching project information from the Tableau server is a preliminary
step for selective extraction. Selective extraction allows you to get a
list of available projects from Tableau then select specific
projects for extraction into the catalog. With permission mirroring
enabled, Alation will fetch all sites and projects from the server, but
the currently logged-in *Server Admin* will only see the sites/projects
they have access to on the Tableau server. This means that if you are a
Tableau server admin with full permissions, you will see all the
sites/projects when you do **Get List of Projects** for your Tableau
source. If you are a user with limited permissions, you will only see
those sites/projects in the fetched list that you have permission to see
in Tableau. also note that fetching projects does not equal
extraction: it is a prerequisite operation that allows an Alation admin
to retrieve a list of projects from which they will later select the
projects for extraction. The fetched listing of sites/projects on the
Tableau source settings page does not reflect the list of workbooks
extracted into the catalog that users see on the respective
catalog pages.

Running Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, selective extraction is disabled and if you leave it
disabled and run extraction, Alation will extract workbooks from all
sites/projects that the **currently logged-in Alation admin** has
access to on the Tableau server. If this Alation admin also is a Tableau
server admin with full permissions, they will extract workbooks from all
the sites/projects on the Tableau server. If they are a user with
limited permissions, they will only extract those workbooks that they
have permission to see in Tableau. 

How Does Permission Mirroring Work?
-----------------------------------

During extraction from Tableau with permission mirroring enabled,
Alation retrieves Tableau user information and permissions for the
extracted objects. Alation only gets information about users with
the View access to Tableau objects. View permission is enough for
Alation as we only need to know if a user "can see" a specific Tableau
object.

Access information is retrieved for **sites**, **projects**, **data
sources**, **workbooks**, and **sheets** currently found on the
Tableau server. Because in Tableau access to objects `is defined by multiple factors <https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/permissions.htm>`_ ,
Alation defines access taking into account both the **site role** of a
user and any **object-level permission rules** enforced through groups
or directly applied to users. We retrieve information on View
permissions for users with all site roles except **Unlicensed**.

First, Alation matches Alation users onto Tableau users, and the matches
are recorded in the Alation server database alongside with the users’
object access information for each extracted object. After user matching
calculation, Alation "knows" which Alation user is also a Tableau user
and which Tableau objects this user can view.

When a user logs in to Alation and opens the catalog page of a Tableau
source, Alation retrieves their Tableau permission information and only
displays the objects they can view in Tableau. If an Alation user does
not have a matching user record in Tableau, they will not see any
objects at all as Alation does not have a Tableau permission record for
them.

For example, a user who has the `Site Administrator <https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/users_site_roles.htm#site-role-capabilities-summary>`_ role
for a site in Tableau will have View access to all child objects on this
site. In Alation, under the Tableau source, this user will be able to
see all the extracted objects for this site (on the condition that all
objects are extracted).

On the other hand, if a user has the Viewer role for a site in Tableau
and is only allowed to see a few specific reports through Tableau access
rules, this user will only see these permitted reports in Alation, but
nothing beyond those allowed objects. The objects that this user cannot
access in Tableau will not appear for this user on the catalog page of
the Tableau source in Alation.

.. note::

     Users with the site role **Unlicensed** will not be able to see any
     extracted objects under a Tableau source in Alation.
