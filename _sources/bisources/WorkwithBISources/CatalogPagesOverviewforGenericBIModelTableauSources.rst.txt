Overview of Catalog Pages for Tableau Sources on the Generic BI Model
=======================================================================

Tableau Server Page
-------------------

When you add a Tableau source to Alation, the top catalog page that
nests all the other pages for this source will be the Tableau **BI
Server** page.

.. note::

    You can find the type of object the current catalog page is for in
    the **Properties** field on the right.


The Tableau Server page has built-in and custom fields currently
associated with the **BI Server template** in your Alation instance.
It has two tabs: **Overview** and **Datasources**.

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~

The **Overview** page includes any custom and built-in fields associated
with the object template and the list of its child objects. Thus, in
the **Folders** field, you will find the Tableau *sites* extracted
for this server with the latest metadata extraction. To view the catalog
page for each specific site, click the site **Name**.

Data Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *data sources* - both published and unpublished - are displayed on
the **Datasources** tab. The workbooks that use them appear in
the **Parent** column. To drill down to the catalog page of each
specific data source, click its **Name**.

Tableau Site Page
-----------------

The site page lists the *projects* extracted from the current site. The
page displays built-in and custom fields currently associated with
the **BI Folder template**. The Tableau projects extracted for this
site are listed in the Folders table. To view data for each
specific project, click its **Name**. 

The page has four tabs, but only the **Overview** tab will display
data for the site. The other tabs - **Reports**, **Sources**, and **Fields** are
not used for the site objects.

Tableau Project Page
--------------------

Each project page lists the child *projects* and *workbooks* extracted for the current project.
The page displays built-in and custom fields currently associated with
the **BI Folder template**. The projects and workbooks extracted for
this parent project can be found in the Folders field under
the **Overview** tab. To view data for each specific project or
workbook, click its **Name**.

The **Sources** tab displays the published data sources used by workbooks in this project.

Tabs **Reports** and **Fields** are not used for the projects and will be empty.

Tableau Workbook Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The page will display built-in and custom fields currently associated
with the **BI Folder template**.

Each workbook page lists the Views extracted for this workbook. The
views can be found on the **Reports** tab of the page. The
Folders field on the **Overview** tab is not used and will be empty for this
type of Tableau object.

If a workbook is using unpublished data sources, they will be
listed on the **Sources** tab.

The published data sources will not appear on this tab,
even if the views may be using them. The workbook **Sources** tab only lists
the embedded (unpublished) data sources. You can find the
published data sources on the catalog pages of the **Sheets** (Dashboards
and Reports) included in this workbook.

The data fields used by all the views in this workbook will be listed on
the **Fields** tab.

To open the dedicated catalog page of a specific view, data source, or field, click its **Name**.

Tableau View Page
-------------------

Each **view** (Report or Dashboard) page is based on the **BI Report
template** and includes:

-  a preview (if preview extraction is enabled) on the **Overview** tab
-  the fields (measures and dimensions) used in this view on the **Fields** tab
-  both published and unpublished datasources that are used in this view on the **Sources** tab
-  table-level data lineage on the **Lineage** tab. 

To drill down into a field or datasource, click its **Name**.

Each extracted view field has a catalog page based on the **BI Report
Column template**. The **Properties** field on the right will
indicate if this field is a measure or a dimension and what data type it
holds. The formula used to calculate the field can be found
under **Expression**.

Data Source Page
----------------

Clicking on a Tableau data source name on any of the catalog pages where
you find it, will bring you to the dedicated page for this data source.
The data source is the source of data that is used to create
Tableau views. Its page is based on the **BI Datasource template** and
includes tabs:

-  **Overview** displays the built-in and custom fields currently
   associated with the template
-  **Fields** lists the *datasource columns* and their properties
-  **Connections** shows the connection information for the
   datasource and points to the source of the data, outside the
   Tableau server. For example, it will show if the datasource is an
   extract or a live database connection and what database connection is
   comes from. The type of connection is indicated under Connection Type
   in **Properties** on the right of the page.
-  **Lineage** for this datasource, shows where the data in the data
   source comes from.
