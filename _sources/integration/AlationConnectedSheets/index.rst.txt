Alation Connected Sheets
========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

Alation Connected Sheets brings spreadsheet users the ability to discover curated data sources from the Alation catalog and download that data with simple clicks without leaving the spreadsheet.

Alation Connected Sheets is supported for Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel 2019 and above, web and desktop client.

With Alation Connected Sheets, spreadsheet users can:

- Discover data sources in your organization’s Alation catalog.
- Use published queries to self-serve data.
- Automate spreadsheet-based reports or dashboards.
- Build real-time reports in a catalog article or web page.
- View quality indicators such as trust information before using data for analysis.
- Customize download specifics such as table, column, or query selections along with filters and sorts using an intuitive graphical user interface—no SQL required!
- Set a refresh schedule to automatically keep the downloaded data up to date and edit your spreadsheet profile. (In Excel, this requires a file stored in OneDrive or SharePoint.)

The first time you log into Alation Connected Sheets for Google Sheets, you may be asked to log into your Google account to allow Alation to access your Google Sheets.

Download Directly Into Spreadsheets
-----------------------------------

Once you’ve signed into your Alation Cloud Service instance, click **Browse Catalog to Download** to view supported database instances:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_BrowseCatalog.png

The **Catalog Browser** dialog appears:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_CatalogBrowser_TopLevel.png
   :class: with-border

You can navigate the catalog in three ways:

#. You can click through the object hierarchy; data sources and queries are available.
#. You can use search to find data objects.

    .. note::

     Search strings are applied on the **Name**, **Title**, and **Description** of the objects.

#. You can paste an object catalog URL into the search box.


As you click through objects, you can view metadata information from the catalog—including any curation information such as trust check flags showing :doc:`Endorsements, Warnings, or Deprecations </sources/WorkwithCatalogData/AddEndorsementsWarningsDeprecationMessagestoData>`:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_CatalogBrowser_TableView.png
   :class: with-border

When you have found a table or query you are interested in, click **Next** to connect to the relevant database. You are prompted to **Save** the Username and Password for the database:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_CatalogBrowser_DBConnect.png
   :class: with-border

You can preview data with filters or sort criteria before the download. You can also select the order of columns in the downloaded data.  On query objects, you can apply filters only if the query supports customizable filter criteria:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_CatalogBrowser_DataPreview.png
   :class: with-border

You must provide a sheet name for the downloaded data set. The data set will be downloaded into a new sheet by default, or you can override this by selecting **Insert into active cell**.

When you are satisfied with your filters and sort criteria, click **Download Data** to complete the download:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_PopulatedSheet.png

.. note::

   There is a limit of 10 million cells in a connected Google Sheet. If you attempt to download more data than will fit into 10 million cells, you will see an error message.

Manage Downloaded Data Configurations
-------------------------------------

Alation Connected Sheets provides a snapshot of all the download dataset configurations in a spreadsheet and provides easy manageability to:

- Instantly refresh data
- Schedule and manage auto-refresh for the data set 
- Edit data source credentials
- View the data in the catalog
- Edit a downloaded configuration
- Delete a downloaded configuration

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_DatasetOptions.png

Schedule Auto-refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation Connected Sheets makes it easy to refresh data and supports the following cadences:

- Hourly: Every 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 hours from a start time
- Daily: Every day at a certain time (hour, minute) of a chosen time zone
- Weekly: Every week, on one or more days at a particular time (hour, minute, and timezone)
- Monthly: Every month on a specific day of month and time (hour, minute) of a chosen time zone

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_ScheduleRefresh.png

Status of the auto-refresh schedule will be reflected in the download sheet snapshot view. You can also opt for notifications for success, failure, or both:

.. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_Notifications.png

.. note:: 

   If using Alation Connected Sheets in Excel, auto-refresh is available only if the spreadsheet is stored in OneDrive or SharePoint.

Edit a Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you select **Edit Configuration** from the options menu, you are taken to the **Data Preview** page, where your options are determined by whether you initially chose a table or a query. If a table, you can change the set of columns selected, their order, filters applied, and sort order. If a query, you can change filters only if the query supports customizable filter criteria.

Make your changes, and then click **Update**. The configuration is updated to reflect your changes.

Sharing Connected Sheets
------------------------

You can share Connected Sheets created with Google Sheets, along with those Connected Sheets created in Excel and stored either in OneDrive or SharePoint. Excel Connected Sheets stored on a local file system cannot be shared.

To share a Connected Sheet:

#. Click the **Share** icon in the Alation Connected Sheets sidebar:

     .. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_ShareSheets.png
        :class: with-border

    The **Share Dataset Connection** opens:

     .. image:: ../../_static/ConnSheets_ShareDatasetConnectionDialog.png
        :class: with-border

#. Click the **Add Users** dropdown. An alphabetical list of users with access to the current spreadsheet appears. You can select from the list or provide an email address to invite a new user.
#. Select a user and click **Add**. The selected user appears under **Who Has Access**.
#. Assign the desired level of access, either **Can View** or **Can Refresh**. Can View access allows the selected user to view the downloaded data and view the data source in the Alation catalog. Refresh access allows the selected user to view and refresh the downloaded data in the shared sheet.
#. Specify whether the selected user must use their own credentials to access the data source or to use shared credentials. When shared credentials are allowed, users with Refresh access can refresh the data source even if they don't have credentials for the data source saved. If users are required to use their own credentials, they will need to update the credentials before refreshing the sheet.

.. _Using the Connected Sheets Hub:

Using the Connected Sheets Hub
------------------------------

The Connected Sheets Hub gives catalog and server admins a convenient view of the Connected Sheets shared in your organization. To access the Hub, ensure that you are logged into Alation as a Catalog Admin or Server Admin and click **Connected Sheets** from the **Apps** menu. The Connected Sheets Hub appears:

.. image:: /_static/ConnSheets_SharedSheetHub.png
   :class: with-border

There are two tabs---by default, the **All Connected Sheets** tab opens.

For each shared Connected Sheet, the Hub shows the file name, file location (Google Drive, OneDrive, or SharePoint), the associated data source, the file owner, and the time the file was last updated. Click the plus sign at the left of any sheet to see more information, including the dataset name and refresh schedule, if any:

.. image:: /_static/ConnSheets_SharedSheetHub_ExpandView.png
   :class: with-border

To view only those Connected Sheets owned by you, select the **My Connected Sheets** tab:

.. image:: /_static/ConnSheets_SharedSheetsHub_MySheets.png
   :class: with-border

While you can see all the shared Connected Sheets from the Hub, you can only open those that have been shared with you individually.
