Use Rich Previews of Alation Catalog Pages
------------------------------------------

When you post a message containing a rich preview of an Alation catalog page, readers can see details about the page directly in Teams without having to go to Alation.

Catalog page previews are interactive. From the preview, you can:

-  Open the catalog page by clicking on the page title.

-  See trust check flags next to the page title. Hover over the icon to see what kind of flag it is.

-  See additional information by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the preview. For example, you can see custom fields for an article or table, a list of columns for a table, raw SQL for a query, and so forth.

-  Click the **Star** button to add the page to your favorites in Alation.

-  Click the **Watch** button to get notifications when the page is updated.

-  For queries, open the query in Compose or open the query form.

-  For Alation Conversations, like the Conversation or mark it as resolved.
