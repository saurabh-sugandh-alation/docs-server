-------------------------

To use Alation Anywhere for Slack, you must be logged into Alation through Slack. To log into the Alation Slack app:

1. Type **/alation login** or attempt to search Alation by typing **/alation search search_term**. A message will appear in Slack asking you to log in.

.. note::

   If you clicked **Not now**, you will be asked to log in again next time you enter an **/alation** command. If you clicked **Don't ask again**, the only way you can log in is by entering **/alation login**.

Log Out of Alation in Slack
---------------------------

To log out of the Alation Slack app, type **/alation logout**. This disconnects Alation from Slack. You will no longer be able to search Alation within Slack or see rich previews of Alation links until you log back in.

Search Alation in Slack
-----------------------

By searching Alation within Slack, you don’t have to leave the context of a Slack conversation to find and post information from your Alation catalog.

To search Alation in Slack, type **/alation search search_terms** in Slack. You can enter one or more words for the search term. Press Enter to submit the search. A pop-up appears showing you the top search result from Alation.

.. note::

   You can also search using the simplified **/alation search_terms** command. But you won’t be able to use the simplified search command to search for words that are reserved as commands, like “help,” “login,” and “logout.” Instead you would have to use the full search command, for example **/alation search login**.

From the search pop-up, you can:

-  Post the top search result to the Slack conversation by clicking **Send it in chat**. A :ref:`preview <preview-alation-catalog-pages-in-slack>` of that catalog page will be sent to the Slack channel. It may be a basic preview or a rich preview, depending on the catalog page.

-  Open the catalog page for the top search result in Alation by clicking the search result’s title.

-  See the top ten search results in Slack by clicking **See more results**. You can then filter by object type, modify the search terms, and resubmit the search to get updated results while still in Slack.

   .. note::

      When viewing multiple search results, each result has its own **Send it in chat** button. The search window stays open when you click this button, so you can send multiple results to the chat quickly. Click **Close** to exit the search window.

      In private channels and direct messages, you can only send up to five results in a row to the chat. To send more, click **Close** to exit the search window and run the same search again.

-  See the full search results in Alation by clicking **Go to Alation Page**.

Preview Alation Catalog Pages in Slack
----------------------------------------------

When you post a Slack message containing a link to an Alation catalog page, a preview of the catalog page appears attached to the message. That way, readers of the message don’t have to go into Alation to understand what you’re talking about.

All catalog pages will show a basic preview in Slack, while certain pages will show a rich preview with additional features.

Catalog pages that have rich previews include:

-  Articles

-  Article groups (old glossaries)

-  Conversations

-  Data source objects

-  Queries

-  Table objects

From a rich preview, you can:

-  Open the catalog page in Alation by clicking on the page title.

-  See additional information by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the preview. For example, you can see custom fields for an article, a list of columns for a table, raw SQL for a query, and so forth. You can also :ref:`view and start Conversations <conversations-in-slack>` about the catalog page.

-  See trust check flags next to the page title. Hover over the icon to see what kind of flag it is.

-  Star or watch the page by clicking **See more** at the bottom of the preview.

-  For queries, open the query in Compose or open the query form by clicking **See more**.

Conversations in Slack
----------------------

.. include:: /shared/2023_3AndNewer.rst

You can interact with Alation Conversations inside Slack, so you don’t have to leave Slack to ask and answer questions in Alation. There are two ways to do this:

-  Paste a direct link to an Alation Conversation in Slack
-  Use the Conversations button on a rich preview of an Alation catalog page in Slack

Direct Link to a Conversation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you post a Slack message containing a link to an Alation Conversation, Slack will show a rich preview of the Conversation where you can see its details and reply to it. In the rich preview, you’ll see the Conversation subject, author, and body, along with links and buttons to interact with the Conversation. From the preview you can:

-  Open the Conversation in Alation by clicking the Conversation subject.
-  Open the author’s user profile in Alation by clicking the author’s name.
-  See details about the Conversation by clicking the **Details** button. You’ll see the Conversation’s assignee, author, participants, and the Alation catalog page the Conversation refers to. Click on any of these to open their corresponding pages in Alation.
-  Reply to the Conversation and see other replies by clicking the **See all replies** button.
-  Resolve or reopen the Conversation by clicking **See more** and then clicking the **Mark Resolved** or **Reopen** button.

Conversations in Rich Previews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Catalog pages that support :ref:`rich previews <preview-alation-catalog-pages-in-slack>` in Slack will have a **Conversations** button. Click the button, and a dialog box will open showing a list of existing Conversations that refer to the catalog object. From there, you can:

-  Open a Conversation in Alation by clicking the Conversation subject.
-  Open an author’s user profile in Alation by clicking the author’s name.
-  Send a rich preview of a Conversation to Slack by clicking the **Send to chat** button. Anyone in the Slack channel can then interact with the Conversation as described above.
-  Start a new Conversation about the catalog object by clicking the **New conversation** button. In the dialog box that appears, enter a subject and body, then click **Post**. This will create the Conversation in Alation, link it to the catalog object, and assign it to you. It will also send a success message to the Slack channel. Next time you view the rich preview for the relevant catalog object and click the **Conversations** button, you can then interact with the new Conversation in Slack.

Get Help in Slack
-----------------

Type **/alation help** in Slack to get help directly within Slack.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you enter an **/alation** command in Slack and get an error message saying **/alation failed with the error "dispatch_failed"**, then your message has failed to reach Alation. Check your internet connection and try again.
