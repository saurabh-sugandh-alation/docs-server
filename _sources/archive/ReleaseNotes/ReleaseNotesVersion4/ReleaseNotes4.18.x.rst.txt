Release 4.18.1
-----------------

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improved performance and hardened MDE extraction for Oracle.

 

Release 4.18.2
-----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Resolved an issue where flags weren't loading correctly for
   ExpressionTemplate and Predicate catalog pages.
-  Resolved an issue that would occur when a data source had Obfuscate
   Literals turned on. A user viewing an obfuscated Compose query would
   see the query as a single line with most whitespace removed and
   literals were replaced with "<var1>". Whitespace is no longer trimmed
   and running the resulting query now prompts the user with a query
   form instead of failing.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed a regression introduced in 4.18.1 where Query Log Ingestion
   would fail on Oracle due to an invalid month parameter.
-  Addressed behavior introduced in 4.6.0 where Metadata Extraction for
   Greenplum and Postgres databases would omit tables which had a
   comment (in the source database) on one of their columns but no
   comment on the table itself. These tables are no longer skipped.

Release 4.18.3
-----------------

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Alation now supports nonstandard system home directory and shell for
   UNIX accounts used by Alation on the server.

Release 4.18.4
-----------------

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improvements to Snowflake support.  Alation now supports metadata
   extraction, sampling, and Compose access for Snowflake Data
   Warehouse.  Query Log Ingestion is not yet supported.

Release 4.18.5
-----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Resolved an issue where Compose results would sometimes not render
   until the user switched tabs and switched back.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest would not return a full
   list of matching objects when the data source has objects with
   uppercase characters in the name.  SmartSuggest should now show up to
   10 matching items, regardless of case.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest did not suggest tables
   in order of popularity.  Now SmartSuggest should suggest the most
   popular tables first.

Release 4.18.7
-----------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Improved support for Tableau release 10.5.

 Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18 which would prevent the "Shared With
   Me" section of the Compose Query Browser from loading.
-  Fixed an issue where Alation would strip all comments from scheduled
   queries and queries run through Excel Live Report. These comments
   could contain semantic content, such as hints to the database engine.
   Alation now sends the comments along with the query, but will not
   send them as a statement by themselves (i.e. a comment that is the
   last line in a query)
-  Fixed an issue where, in some enterprise environments, Alation was
   unable to provision linux system users with the right permissions in
   the Alation Shell environment, which would result in a failure during
   software upgrade. Alation will now check and reset the permissions if
   necessary.
-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18.0 where killing an in-progress Tableau
   Extraction or Virtual Data Source upload job would hide the status of
   any current or past jobs of that type. The actual jobs would continue
   to run on schedule, but not be visible in the settings pages. This
   could happen if the machine or server was restarted in the middle of
   one of these jobs or they were killed by the OS or a sysadmin. Now,
   current and past Tableau Extraction and Virtual Data Source upload
   jobs will show on settings pages.
-  This release disables a control for video uploads to the rich text
   editor (used in Articles). Previously, video files were being
   uploaded to an external website for staging purposes. We have
   verified that any uploaded videos were deleted from the external
   server shortly after upload. Users can continue to embed video from
   YouTube, Vimeo and other sources.
