Release Notes 4.0.0
===================

As a little gift from Alation to end 2016 on a high note, Alation 4.0
includes major upgrades to how users can work with code, text, and tags,
and how Catalog and Compose can connect to Big Data sources.

Facelift
--------

In addition to new functionality, we’ve also begun the process of giving
a user-interface facelift to every element and screen across the
Alation product suite, to make them more modern, elegant, organized,
usable, legible, and consistent. In this release, we’ve given the
facelift to Compose, to rich-text elements, and to large swathes of the
most-used data catalog pages like the Table page.

Beyond providing an improved look-and-feel, the facelift also
allows more informative content to fit on screen.

Compose
-------

In 4.0, we’ve upgraded the way Compose looks and feels, so it’s nicer to
look at and easier to use.

Color Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing you’ll notice upon opening the revamped Compose is that
you now have the power to choose from a variety of themes. The new
default is light and airy and matches the UI of Catalog. It’s also
optimized for legibility. That’s the facelift in action! Or you can
revert to the old colors, pick the light-on-dark interface, or go for
something more creative. You’ll be prompted to make a selection when
you next open Compose, but you can change your mind any time in
Settings.

Tabs
~~~~

Ever opened so many queries you can’t even read their names in the
scrunched tabs?
Now query tabs  will have a minimum width and extra tabs can be
seen and visited using a simple menu, or with horizontal scrolling.

Text Editor, Articles, and Tags 
--------------------------------

Alation 4.0 also includes many improvements to how you can write, edit,
and share articles, business glossary terms, and other pages in Alation.
We’ve...

incorporated a powerful new rich-text editor  with

-  enhanced HTML table  support, including the ability to easily
   add and remove rows and columns and merge cells, and
-  better image editing  (including WYSIWYG resizing and
   border-customization);

rewritten our architecture for saving such that

-  work-in-progress gets autosaved  every few seconds so you’ll
   never lose your work, and
-  you can make a quick change to a single field  without having to
   enter Edit mode; and

added an additional Share setting  so you can invite a user
to view a private page but not edit it.

We’ve also separated out the concepts of Tags and Articles. Tags now
have their own icon and you can find items with a given tag using
Alation Search on the left-hand side of your instance.

Oh, and the new and improved editor  applies to rich-text fields
throughout the Catalog—like Descriptions, for example.

Connectivity
------------

We’ve bolstered our support
for Presto  and SparkSQL  (rounding out
our SQL-on-Hadoop  offering for Hive, Impala, and Teradata
QueryGrid).

Bugs
----

And we also fixed numerous bugs including those where

the Columns tab loads slowly on pages for tables with many columns

the data uploader

-  loads slowly for large schemas and data sources
-  cannot upload data to DB2
-  truncates BIGINT fields

Compose results from Presto sometimes show cells in the wrong timezone

Query Forms sometimes fail to execute properly.

For Admins
----------

We've made improvements to...

-  enable sending a DELETE method via the BULK API
-  optimize Microstrategy extraction
-  let you configure your organization’s instance so data samples are
   collected and stored per user with their DB credentials, rather than
   being cached and shared across users. This option may appeal to
   organizations with critical per-user restrictions being enforced by
   the database. If you’re interested in Per-User Data Profiling, please
   contact your Alation Solutions Engineer.

And we've fixed the bugs where...

-  Tableau Data Source extraction requires Tableau Server
   admin-privileges
-  Teradata metadata extraction for custom views is broken
-  the top-level Settings page is accessible to non-admins
-  it is not possible to import fully qualified table/column names
   through API
-  the QLI Push API error reports are difficult to interpret
-  already-ingested events aren’t being appropriately skipped during
   query log ingestion
-  Greenplum log fetching does not skip empty logs
