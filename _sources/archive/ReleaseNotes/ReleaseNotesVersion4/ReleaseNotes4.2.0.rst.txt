Release Notes 4.2.0
===================

Improvements

-  A new oft-requested feature: you will now get email
   notifications for DBA-relevant events, e.g. if Metadata Extraction
   fails. Admins can disable this in their notification preferences.
-  We've also improved our APIs by

   -  fixing the bug where the Alation API token can only be
      retrieved when using built-in authentication (You can now fetch
      your API token from the "Misc" tab in the Admin Settings UI)
   -  and adding the ability to

      -  filter results by Picker, Date, or Text Custom Fields in the
         Metadata GET API
      -  and disable propagation of titles/descriptions added via API to
         derived columns using a parameter.

-  We now show the timezone in log timestamps
-  We updated the Alation Repair action to fix permissions on PostgreSQL
   data directory
-  and added readline library to chroot so we can use arrow keys in the
   Python shell.

Bug Fixes

-  fixed the bug where Alation services are not automatically started
   after a reboot
