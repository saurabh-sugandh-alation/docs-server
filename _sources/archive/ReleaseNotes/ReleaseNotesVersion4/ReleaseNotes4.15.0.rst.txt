Release Notes 4.15.0
====================

Release 4.15.0
--------------

While working hard behind-the-scenes on big improvements and new
features for Alation 5.0, our team also fixed a bunch of bugs.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Now, if you lose network connectivity while on an Alation page,
   clicking a link will show an error message, and if you regain
   connectivity, clicking the link will work. Previously, nothing
   would happen when connectivity was lost, even if it was subsequently
   regained (until a full page refresh)! 

   .. note::

      Note: in some cases, the error will come in the form of a clear,
      actionable alert pop-up, while in others, it will wrongly display
      a 404 error.

-  Now, Allie the Robot’s head will once again turn green when you
   confirm an auto-generated title at the top of a Catalog page. A
   regression had caused the head to just disappear after confirmation.
-  While entering an email address in a text editor for a catalog
   object, typing the ‘@‘ symbol will no longer trigger the
   inline-mention box popping up. The box will now appear only
   when ‘@‘ is typed after whitespace.
-  Now, when editing a link in an article, labels and input boxes
   maintain the correct spacing. Previously, the URL and link text would
   get obscured by the labels for those fields in the popover.
-  Previously, on the Query Search page, you could hover over a link on
   some queries to see a "details" popover showing which tables were
   mentioned in a given query, but when you moved your mouse to
   click on those table links, the popover would close. Now it stays
   open so you can click on the links.
-  Now if you mouse over the Compose button on a Catalog Page on a Data
   Source where Compose is disabled, we’ll show a
   tooltip explaining why.  Previously there was no tooltip.
-  You can once again view Custom BI report pages. A regression
   introduced in 4.13.1, made those pages show up blank when the server
   type was not MicroStrategy.
-  Formatting is now respected for long Set-propagated
   titles which extends far to the right. Before the propagated title
   would overlap with the local title.
-  Users can now upload CSV files with non-ASCII (e.g. Cyrillic)
   characters to data dictionary.
-  And we fixed a bug where loading more results in Quick
   Search did not work if the browser window was very large.

 

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ve improved our API documentation to be more readable,
accurate, and up-to-date, and fixed a couple bugs.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Alation supports QLI for Hive using Tez execution engine. This
   support is now generally available after a successful Beta
   release.
-  Query Log Ingestion for DB2 sources now handles queries longer
   than 30 minutes. Previously, QLI would fail if queries of such a long
   duration were in the log.
