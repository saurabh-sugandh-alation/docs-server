Release Notes 4.13.0
====================

Release 4.13.0
--------------

New Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alation now makes itself available as a search option in
   browsers. For instance, in Chrome it will now be possible to type
   "myalationhost.com" and press Tab to search Alation directly from the
   Chrome address bar.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Tableau permissions mirroring no longer requires admin access for
   the service account.
-  Catalog page layouts have been improved for a more pleasing and
   consistent catalog browsing experience.
-  Admins can now confirm a user's email address from the admin user
   management screen. In the case where email delivery is failing
   (usually because the email server is not configured properly), this
   allows admins to manually confirm the user so they can log in. (While
   only admins can use this functionality, end users directly benefit;
   we thought you'd like to know :).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Catalog Sets now show up in search with the 'Recently Visited' filter
   (clock icon).
-  It is now possible to easily delete Custom Fields in Internet
   Explorer. Previously a UI glitch made this challenging.
-  Data Dictionary Upload now works for non-ASCII characters.
   Previously, they'd show up strangely. 
-  Now scheduled queries do not execute while their author is
   suspended. They will run again on their regular schedule if the
   author is activated again. Previously, scheduled queries for a user
   would continue to run after they were suspended. 
-  Hovering over a truncated Hive table data location or Data
   Source URI in the sidebar of the catalog page will now show the
   full location in a peek, with the ability to select and copy it.
   Previously, it was challenging to see the full form.
-  Search indexing now continues to work overall even if a particular
   object can't be indexed for any reason. This means search will work
   more reliably.
-  It is now possible to profile individual columns on Oracle Data
   Sources.
-  Allie Auto-titling now works for object names with spaces (e.g
   "bg tbl") . Previously it would only recognize names with "_" (e.g.
   "bg_tbl").
-  It is now possible to disable notifications for weekly metadata
   changes. Previously, there was a UI error while attempting to
   disable notifications. 
-  Users can now upload and download a data dictionary without any error
   even when Cyrillic characters are used in Custom Fields.
-  You can now go to the "Other" tab in your User Preferences to see and
   set Excel export options for specific environments (for instance,
   to optimize for Mac or Windows). 
-  We no longer create catalog pages for temp tables. Previously,
   when a user ran a CREATE TEMP TABLE query from Compose, we created a
   catalog page for it, which was confusing intrinsically and caused
   further confusion in the Lineage graph.
-  The "Ask a Colleague" (?) button is now visible everywhere it
   used to be. In 4.12 it disappeared from some locations.
-  Alation now supports non-ASCII characters in usernames.
-  You can now use the keyboard to highlight the "File Systems"
   facet in Quick Search, and select it using Enter.
-  You can now edit Description and Custom Rich Text Fields from
   within the Advanced Search interface.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The Lexicon page is no longer partially obscured by the site's
   top banner.
   The backup schedule can now be changed.
-  A *-p* option has been added to alation_conf so you can pretty
   print the details on which config options are available and what
   they do.
-  The MySQL JDBC driver has been upgraded to 5.1.43.
-  QLI for Hive Datasources with keytab-based Kerberos authentication is
   now supported.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The user signup page will not appear if you've chosen Single Sign-On
   for authentication (SAML).
-  It is now possible to activate/suspend a user who is not one of the
   top 100 in the list, without the whole list disappearing.
-  For SAP HANA Data Sources, \_SYS_BIC is now extracted when Alation
   extracts all schemas. Previously, this was considered a system schema
   and not extracted by default.
-  Now, when a Tableau workbook owner changes, the catalog will reflect
   that change upon re-extraction.
