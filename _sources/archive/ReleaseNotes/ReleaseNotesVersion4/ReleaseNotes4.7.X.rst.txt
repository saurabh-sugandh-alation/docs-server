Release Notes 4.7.X
===================

Release 4.7.0
-------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In the Catalog Browser, the article card now defaults to the
   more-popular Taxonomy View.  If you switch to List View, the toggle
   is now sticky, so List View will show on reload.
-  You can now choose to limit which Tableau projects are extracted to
   Alation, previously restrictions were based on Tableau Server
   permissions. 
-  In the lineage tab on BI object catalog pages, the current object is
   now highlighted in orange in the lineage graph.
-  In Advanced Search, we no longer show facets for custom text fields,
   since the values are often paragraph-form text which is not suitable
   for faceting.
-  In search and @-mention boxes, we now boost the ranking of exact
   matches of qualified object names like schema.table or table.column
-  When running queries on Hive, Compose now shows the hive execution
   log as the query is running, providing better visibility into the
   progress as well as clearer error messages.
-  We no longer show deleted items in the expertise list on a user
   profile page.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When you are viewing a snippet of SQL, the text will now wrap around,
   so you can view the entire content.
-  Save/Cancel buttons stay showing when a text field is in edit mode
   even if you mouse away.  
-  Filter box stays showing when you are filtering a table, even if you
   mouse away.
-  We now correctly make links open in a new tab when that option is
   selected in the link editor on any rich text field.
-  When viewing results against an Oracle database using an aggregation
   function, you can receive the full results. Previously, we truncated
   the results. 
-  In 4.6.0 we introduced a regression that prevented @-mentions from
   being updated when the title of the mentioned object was updated.
    Re-titling an object will now update any @-mention links in
   descriptions, articles, conversations, and custom text fields.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  In this release, it is possible to work with your Alation Support rep
   to tune your Alation instance for faster Hive Tez QLI.
-  We now allow kerberos configuration in the Deployment Wizard by
   entering a JDBC URI directly (rather than relying on us to build it
   by entering a host, port, and kerberos principal).
-  When users sign up with SSO or LDAP, they no longer are provided the
   option to change their email address, since we rely on the email
   address from the authentication system.

Release 4.7.1
-----------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  We’ve updated UI of Tableau pages on Alation. Now Tableau workbook
   pages are consistent with the rest of Catalog.
-  We've extended Tableau lineage support. We added support for
   federated public and private data sources, workbooks created with
   earlier Tableau versions, etc.

Admin Release Notes
-------------------

Now you can control which sites and projects Alation should index during
Tableau metadata extraction. We added site/project picker to Tableau
Settings Page (similar to schema picker for data source metadata
extraction). To use that functionality the service account should have
site admin privileges. 

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We improved the mirroring of Tableau permissions on Alation. Now
   Alation respects more detailed permission model, that includes
   server/site admin privileges, deny privileges and other types.

-  Improved logging for Tableau metadata extraction, including detailed
   information about skipped workbooks.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We now extract all Tableau workbooks. This feature is behind a flag.
   Since the functionality requires site admin privileges for the
   Alation service account and won’t work with a regular service
   account. Once you update Alation service account, you can turn those
   features on.
