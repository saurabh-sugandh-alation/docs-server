Release Notes 4.5.0
===================

Improvements
-----------------

-  Compose Performance: We are consistently working to improve
   Compose performance. In this release, we made a lot of behind the
   scenes improvements in order to enhance your experience and
   efficiency when using Compose. 
-  Catalog Column Page: Catalog Column pages now have the same
   updated layout as Table Catalog pages. 
   
-  Rich Metadata Displayed in Catalog: We now display new metadata
   for Table and Column Catalog pages. We display source comments
   imported from the database, keys & indices details. As well as
   exposing Table descriptions, table synonyms, and the "last altered"
   timestamp.
-  We've added support for a new authentication method on SQL Server

Integrations

   execution engine to compute usage stats, identify top users, and
   more.

   "certified" in Tableau Server
