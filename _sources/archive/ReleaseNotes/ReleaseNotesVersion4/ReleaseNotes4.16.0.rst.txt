Release Notes 4.16.0
====================

Release 4.16.0
--------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If you have Tableau 10.4+, Alation can be configured
   so Endorsements on Tableau Data Source (TDS) pages in Alation
   Catalog will be surfaced as Certifications on Tableau Server.
-  It is now possible to configure and extract HDFS data lakes much
   like Alation could with Amazon S3 before. This functionality is in Beta and
   behind a Flag for Data Lakes/File Systems.Any distribution/version of
   HDFS that supports the WebHDFS REST protocol is supported, but some
   have been more thoroughly tested than others. Check out the Install
   Guide and talk to your Solutions Engineer.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If your admins do some set-up, you can see Expressions and Values
   for MicroStrategy reports as well as custom fields on their
   catalog pages (but not Lineage).
-  You can now decide whether or not to receive e-mail notifications
   when you’re mentioned in articles and conversations. Go to the
   Notifications tab under Account Settings to flip the switch.
-  On Table pages for Vertica data sources, we show new technical
   metadata fields from the database under Properties on the right
   side: Owner, Last Updated, and Created Time.  

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Mentioning Groups in articles and conversations will now cause
   notification e-mails to be sent to group members. Previously, this
   did not work properly.
-  Previously, when a scheduled query was triggered to run
   significantly after the actual scheduled time (by more than 30
   minutes, by default), the owner of the scheduled query would receive
   an email with a vague message about a failure to run the query. Now
   they'll receive a clearer message in the email about how the
   server missed the window of acceptable time for scheduled query
   execution.

   -  by default, the “acceptable delay” is set to 30 minutes. This
      threshold can be changed by setting alation_conf
      alation.query_exec.scheduling.delay_tolerance

-  Search with deduplication now runs more performantly. Previously, a
   large number of network requests could be generated by such searches.
-  Now accurate column-counts will be shown for tables with colons in
   their names. Previously, such tables would always be listed as having
   0 columns.
-  When titles are being edited within Alation tabular views, their
   cells now display consistently across browsers. Previously, Firefox
   and IE displayed differently.
-  Better Error Handling on page load:

   -  Now, the correct indicator will be shown when the network
      connection is lost. Previously, such a connectivity issue would
      show up as a 404 error, suggesting that the desired page didn’t
      exist.
   -  You’ll now more consistently see a 500 Error when there’s an issue
      from Alation Server. Previously, some server errors would be
      mistakenly surfaced as “connection errors.”

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Query Log Ingestion now works for

   -  PostgreSQL
   -  Snowflake SQL
   -  SAP HANA SQL

-  We now offer a public API to get the latest visible query result ID.
    API Documentation and examples can be
   found `here <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/query-apis>`_.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  If you turn on a back-end flag by running alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True  then
   all MicroStrategy Report Sources created after that point will
   show Values and Expressions and support Custom Fields. The lineage
   tabs on those pages will be disabled, however. Note: the changes
   will not be applied to previously added sources, only to those added
   while the flag is on.*
-  You can now set a Display Name in Admin Settings > Email
   and Admin Emails will show up as from the value in that
   field. If you manage multiple instances (e.g. separate Staging and
   Prod servers) you can include indicators in the display names on each
   to more readily distinguish them in your inbox.
-  You can now see Database type in Data Source Settings, and
   will also get a more detailed error message displayed if the wrong
   URI is entered. This is especially useful when using Compose over a
   virtual source.
-  In Admin Settings > Misc, you can choose to hide the Tile View of
   the Reports Card in the Left-Hand Navigation bar, leaving just the
   name-based browser.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  When rejecting a pending user, the confirmation modal no longer
   persists after you push Confirm.
-  Data profiling now works in Hive for tables and columns
   with names which are also reserved keywords. This support was
   included in 4.14.0 for other data sources.
-  Metadata GET API for Vertica sources now consistently works.
   Previously, it would fail if a database name was specified in the
   URI.
-  Metadata extraction is now more robust; previously, certain
   combinations of metadata changes could break Metadata Extraction for
   database types that have a multi-part schema names.
-  When rejecting a pending user, the confirmation modal no longer
   persists after you push Confirm.
-  When you select Admin Settings > Misc > Prepare Encrypted Logs for
   Download, a disk space check is performed first. Previously, the
   application would crash if there was insufficient space.
-  We can now extract Tableau Workbooks with names that include
   non-ASCII characters. Previously, users would see an encoding error.
-  Alation now properly handles case sensitivity for Teradata
   datasources when specifying schema exclusions in Extraction settings.
-  Previously, File System extraction would report the total number of
   objects extracted and call them all files. Now, the interface
   clarifies that the number represents the total of both files or
   directories.
