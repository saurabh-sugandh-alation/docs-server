Release Notes 4.10.X
====================

Release 4.10.0
---------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  License Warnings - We have added warnings when your license is going
   to expire for both admins and other users, and improved the ability
   to install an updated license file.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Updated Catalog pages for Business Intelligence Tools - Catalog pages
   for Business Intelligence tools have been updated to the latest
   components from our design system. This improves consistency and
   readability.
-  Enhancing LDAP User Information with Departments - With LDAP
   authentication, we now are extracting the user's department from LDAP
   in addition to email, title, photo, and more. The attribute is
   configurable under the authentication page. If the information is
   pulled successfully (i.e., there is a department info in LDAP), the
   department of each user should show up in the user profile page,
   right after the title. Otherwise, nothing will change.
-  Streamlining the Statement Template Catalog Page - On the Run details
   of a statement Template Catalog page, we now only list statements
   with execution statistics.
-  All Compose Sidebars Reload on Refresh - Compose should load a little
   more quickly and take a little less memory when many query tabs are
   open. More improvements to come!
-  View SQL Now Captured for a MySQL View - Added support for view
   definition SQL for MySQL data sources. This also enables lineage for
   MySQL views.
-  Comments in Excel Live and Scheduled Queries - Previously, Alation
   ran the entire query, including comments, so if a comment preceded
   the SQL statement users might not get their actual results. Now,
   Excel live reports and scheduled query execution skip comments in the
   SQL to streamline your results.
-  Relevant Articles - @-mentions from custom text fields on Articles
   now cause the Article to be included in the Relevant Articles section
   of the mentioned object. Previously, this functionality was only
   available for mentions in the body of an Article. 

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default Hat Needs Page Reload - When default hat is set to a particular
value, new users in Alation will see articles on the home page that is
targeting the correct hat on first page load, not requiring a refresh.

Custom Field Permissions Not Respected in Search - Previously during
search, we were showing values in custom field facets that the user may
not have permission to see. Now, we exclude custom field values from
search faceting if there is any view restriction at all (even though the
individual user who is querying may have permission).

@-Mention Notifications - Previously, the notification of @-mention in
an article used to say the @-mention was done by the original author.
Now, it correctly says the @-mention was done by the editor of the
change.

@-Mention in Articles - @-mentions on UK (and other) keyboards now show
icons for all BI servers, conversations, groups, and glossaries, and
produces the dropdown in Articles.

Image Formatting in Articles - Previously, images aligned center or
aligned right in the rich text editor were always aligned left in the
view mode. Now they will be displayed with the alignment set in the
editor. Furthermore, now, when you scroll down on a long rich text field
(enough that the header sticks to the top of the screen) the insert
menus in the toolbar will continue to work properly.

Tables Not Loading Completely - Fixed an issue that prevented sample
column from rendering when it contains an uploaded description.

Title History in Query Search Opens Catalog Page - Now, clicking on the
title history button in query search properly opens the title history
modal.

Updated Catalog Child Tables - We updated the user interface (UI) for
schemas in a data source and tables in a schema. The new UI has slightly
reduced functionality, but much higher reliability. While this first
iteration does not offer highlighting of filter matches, exporting, or
expanding functionality, it does fix frustrating bugs:

-  Edits on the second or later pages of the results take effect
   immediately
-  Sorting after an edit works reliably and doesn't revert to the
   pre-edited data

Copy/pasting schema.tablename from Table Catalog Page - Now, copying and
pasting schema.table from the breadcrumbs on catalog pages will include
the ".”

Incomplete Stewards Lists - Previously, lists of stewards would
sometimes be incomplete if they included a group and a user with the
same ID. Now, all stewards lists are complete.

Un-Parseable Compose Queries Cause Crashes - It is no longer possible
for queries that take a long time to parse to cause a service outage.
Previously, certain queries could take a very long time to parse.
Computing warnings on compose queries requires parsing the query and
would hold some web server resources while waiting. If this happened
enough, it would lead to a temporary service outage until the parsing
finished or timed out. Now, the web server only waits a few seconds for
parsing and then gives up without parsing the query so it should not
lead to any service outages. 

Large Exports Get Cut Off - Previously, when a user clicks "Export" in
Compose and their connection to the Alation server is slow, the export
would sometimes cut out prematurely without any error message.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you can control which sites and projects Alation should index during
Tableau metadata extraction. We added site/project picker to Tableau
Settings Page (similar to schema picker for data source metadata
extraction). This feature was introduced
in :doc:`Release Notes 4.7.1 </archive/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesVersion4/ReleaseNotes4.7.X>` as
a beta feature and is now available to all. Furthermore, this version
includes updated:

-  Extractions: This release includes several improvements to
   extraction of Tableau metadata, both improving speed and reliability
   as well as fixing issues we noticed with beta customers;
-  Permissions: We improved the mirroring of Tableau permissions on
   Alation. Now Alation respects more detailed permission model, that
   includes server/site admin privileges, deny privileges and other
   types. To use this feature, Alation must use the same authentication
   mechanism as Tableau (e.g. LDAP) and Alation service account needs
   additional privileges.

Admins will now see a redesigned the user management interface
including:

-  More consistent and readable UI components;

-  Ability to distinguish between pending users and suspended users;

-  UI updates without a refresh when you make changes;

-  Usernames and email addresses for users;

-  Ability to filter users by name, username, and email;

-  Ability to sort users by last login time;

-  One-click approve all pending users;

-  Ability to reject pending users and remove them from the list;

Restore Fails if Alation Not Started - Previously, attempting to restore
a backup of Alation while the Alation instance was not running would
fail. Now the restore script starts all necessary processes before
attempting to restore data.

[BETA] Surfacing Top Departments - Alation already lists the individual
users who’ve most often queried a data object under Top Users. With this
extension, we look at LDAP information about departments (if present) to
summarize which departments most often query the data. So if the top
users are all in Finance or Operations, that will be surfaced. This can
turn a list of individuals’ names that a given viewer might not
recognize into actionable insight about the use-cases for a data set.
With the feature flag enable_top_departments, we offer functionality to:

-  disable adding/removing top users; thereby separating the
   manually-curated content on the page from the behavioral information
   gleaned directly from logs;
-  enable hiding top users and departments; 

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Increased Security - We modified a Flash Parameter,
   AllowScriptAccess, to prevent a SWF file hosted from one domain from
   accessing a script in an HTML page in another domain.
-  Microsoft Exchange Email Compatibility - Reply-by-email can now be
   configured with a Microsoft Exchange Email account.  Choose the
   recommended “Intent Tracking Mode” under “Email Interactions” in the
   “Email Server” tab of Admin Settings.
-  Shorter Log Level for Long Statements - Alation no longer logs every
   single ingested query event that was skipped because it was too long.
   The Query Ingestion settings page will continue to show the total
   number of skipped events for each ingestion to streamline your
   results. Previously, the log would show one line for each query that
   was too long and also send an error report.

Release 4.10.1
------------------------

In this update, we fixed bugs that we discovered in 4.10.0.

Bug Fixes for Admins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Upgrade Failure - Upgrades to 4.10 sometimes failed because of a new
   feature, that failure has been fixed.
-  Tableau Extraction - Fixed a bug regarding failure in Tableau
   extraction.
-  Tableau Setting Page Password - We fixed a bug where the Tableau
   setting page dropped the first character in password.

 

Release 4.10.2
------------------------

In this update, we fixed bugs discovered in 4.10.1.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  403 Errors When Using IE - Fixed a 403 error that was seen on many
   pages when using Internet Explorer. Now, Internet Explorer works
   again.
-  'Download Excel Live Report' Option in Share Dropdown Not Working -
   Previously, clicking on 'Download Excel Live Report' option in share
   dropdown did not show the Download Excel Live Report modal box. Now,
   the modal box shows.
-  License Lockout Screen Shown Incorrectly - Users were redirected to
   lockout screen when their browser became disconnected from the server
   even though the server had a valid license (see 4.10.1 for more on
   Licenses).  This no longer happens.
-  [Admins] Tableau Fix: New users created if not present on Alation -
   Previously, we created users for each of the Tableau workbook owners
   if they were not a user on Alation yet, but these accounts were often
   not desired as Alation accounts.  Now, user accounts are no longer
   created during Tableau extraction.

Release 4.10.3
------------------------

Bug Fixes for Everyone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now set Excel export options for specific environments (for
instance, to optimize for Mac or Windows) in the "Other" tab in your
User Preferences.

The list of projects on the Tableau settings page now lists all
projects, rather than a partial list.

On some versions of Internet Explorer …

-  …typing into many text boxes on the site did not work; now all text
   input boxes should work.
-  …placeholder text was difficult to distinguish from inputted text.
   Now filled-in fields and placeholder text are easily
   distinguishable.
-  … Catalog page content would sometimes overflow the boundaries of
   the page. Now that overflow should no longer occur.
-  … some pages did not load properly. Now they do.

Bug Fixes for Admins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Now an upgrade will work even if the dumps directory is absent.
   Previously upgrades would fail if that folder could not be found.
-  Now if a license file can't be found during an attempted upgrade,
   Alation will display a clear, actionable error message. The earlier
   message was confusing.
