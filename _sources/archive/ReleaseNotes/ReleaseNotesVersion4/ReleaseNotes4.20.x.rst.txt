Release Notes 4.20.x
====================

Release 4.20.0
-----------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alation now provides a public API to interact with articles. The API
   provides an interface for all CRUD operations, allowing for
   programmatic management of articles. For further details and code
   samples, refer to the API documentation.
-  Users can now perform searches based on the contents of Rich Text
   fields, allowing users for data sources that match broader criteria.
   This is enabled for both quick and advanced search. Note that
   after upgrading, it will likely take several hours to re-index
   objects and see this change come into effect.
-  On Table Catalog Pages for Hive Data Sources, Alation now shows a
   link in Properties to the Catalog page for the Amazon S3 or HDFS file or
   directory that backs the Hive Table. The HDFS or S3 File System must
   also be cataloged in Alation for this feature to work. On HDFS and S3
   File System catalog pages, Alation now shows a link in Properties to
   the Catalog page to the Hive Table if this file backs the Hive
   Table. To enable this, the alation.feature_flags.enable_hive_links
   feature flag must be set to True.
-  Customize Catalog now includes a new Custom Field type: Multi-Select
   Picker. Similar to Picker, it provides a dropdown menu to select from
   predefined values, but with a checklist for multiple value
   selection. Advanced Search allows faceting by values in these fields.
-  For users of Compose, Trust Check is now available in conjunction
   with Compose Previews to trust the data they're querying. With Trust
   Check, flags added to the catalog are shown to the right users at the
   right time, so they have more impact with less effort. The data
   objects documented in the catalog are now brought forward in Compose
   through color coded highlights or underlines in the query text as you
   type. Users have control over the indicators in Compose. They can
   choose whether to get indicators for deprecations, warnings, and
   endorsements, or for objects without any quality flags.  In 4.20.0,
   this feature is behind a feature flag and can be enabled with
   \`alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_semantics_check -s True\`
-  Catalog sets now allow users to pick and choose specific objects
   (Datasource, Database Catalog, Schema, Table, Column) through the
   "Manual" set tab (accessible through Admin -> Catalog Sets). This is
   helpful when simple conditional rules can't express the group. In
   addition, users now have the ability to sync fields
   (title/description, custom fields, flags and tags) across the
   children of the manual set members. Once the manual set is created,
   the fields that have to be synced can fully be customized through the
   "Sync Children" tab on the catalog set page. This is useful when
   there are duplicate items (with the same name) across different
   schemas or datasources and fields would normally have to be copied
   manually to the duplicates. When syncing is enabled for the first
   time or the sync settings are modified, the metadata is copied from
   the children in the order of how their parents were added in the set.
   Metadata is synced across the children when one of the children is
   modified (through catalog UI / API / data dictionary upload). More
   details on how syncing works is present on the "Sync Children" tab.
   With Manual Catalog Sets enabled, Object Equivalence feature is
   deprecated, as Manual Catalog Sets support synchronization of tags,
   flags, and custom fields, in addition to title and description.
   Existing Schema Equivalences defined on the Object Equivalence tab in
   Admin Settings have been migrated to Schema Manual Catalog Sets with
   children syncing (for tables and columns) on title and description.
   Object Equivalence can still be used when Manual Catalog Sets is
   disables. As Object Equivalence is a deprecated feature, it will be
   removed from Alation in the near future. The new catalog set features
   can be enabled by \`alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_cognates -s True`. Any user can
   create/view manual sets but field synchronization settings can be
   enabled/modified only by admins.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  For users using the "governance officer hat", the Governance Tracking
   Dashboard is now populated by default. This was previously behind a
   configuration flag, obscuring the feature. Every 6 hours a new data
   point will be added.
-  There is now an option on the Notification tab of the User accounts
   page to opt out of all notifications at once. In addition, an option
   has been added to opt out of License warnings. These reduce the
   amount of noise a user will have to filter through in a given day.
-  For users of the Report Sources API, the API now allows filtering of
   datatables and report objects by ID. For example, GET
   /catalog/reportobject?id=1 will return the report object with an ID
   of 1, where previously a user could only get All objects. This should
   simplify any scripts that use this API, as well as reduce network
   load from the Alation server.
-  After Data Profiling, empty tables are no longer reported as
   permission errors, instead saying "No rows at time of last sample".

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18 which made the "Open With" menu appear
   on schema, table, and column pages even if there were no applications
   available in the menu. Now the "Open With" menu only appears if there
   are available applications.
-  A bug has been fixed where arbitrary users could attempt to edit the
   title of a query on the Query Catalog page. For any user that did not
   author the query, the edit button is now disabled and a tooltip is
   displayed explaining why.
-  Fixed a bug where using keyboard navigation to select object types in
   LHN Search Box, @-mentions, and Object Set Fields selected the wrong
   object type
-  Fixed a bug where flags weren't loading correctly for
   ExpressionTemplate and Predicate catalog pages.
-  Resolved an issue that would occur when a data source had Obfuscate
   Literals enabled. A user viewing an obfuscated Compose query would
   see the query as a single line with most whitespace removed and
   literals were replaced with "<var1>". Whitespace is no longer trimmed
   and running the resulting query now prompts the user with a query
   form instead of failing.
-  Fixed a bug on Schema, Table, and Column Catalog pages in IE10 where
   it was not possible to click the edit button for the title if there
   was also a title added by a Catalog Set. Now it is possible to click
   the edit button and edit the title.
-  Untitled items would occasionally display incorrect titles in the
   Catalog Browser. Now items correctly display their Untitled status.
-  The notification setting for mentions in an article or conversation
   (on the user account settings page) now correctly prevents
   notifications from being sent when the option is turned off.
-  Fixed a bug for Curator Users where the 'Track' dropdown would not
   properly display menu options until the user hovered over the
   dropdown.
-  On the Data Source settings page, clicking the white space
   surrounding a checkbox will no longer activate that checkbox.
-  Fixed an issue where Compose was attempting to extract metadata for
   Teradata Temp tables. This was causing frequent error warnings to
   show up for Teradata users. Now Compose avoids attempting to extract
   metadata for newly created temp tables in Teradata using the keyword
   "set" or "multiset", whether "volatile" or "global temporary".
-  For MicroStrategy users, previews of Microstrategy dashboards are no
   longer cropped, and the aspect ratio is now the same as the actual
   dashboard, allowing for more accurate visual identification of a
   dashboard without needing to click in and confirm.
-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18 where the Catalog page for a Tableau
   Server would sometimes fail to render.
-  Fixed a bug where changes to column headings on the Glossary page
   would revert after reloading the page. Changes will now persist as
   they should.
-  The public API to upload a preview image to a BI report will now
   return an error message if the report doesn't exist. Previously it
   would just appear to be "running" forever and not complete.
-  Fixed a bug where Alation would display an incorrect table count for
   a schema with a single quote in the name.
-  Fixed a bug on the Execution Result and Article pages where a user
   who requested access might see a loading indicator that would never
   finish. This occurred if there was an error sending the email. The UI
   now informs the user of any errors.
-  In Custom Templates, "Attribute custom templates" has been renamed to
   "Column custom templates" to match with the vernacular of the rest of
   the product.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Admin can now toggle feature flags on/off via a new feature flag
   admin page, reducing the need to use the alation shell. Changing
   flags will cause all users' pages to reload
-  Alation can now collect query logs for PostgreSQL data sources.
   Admins can configure Query Log Ingestion through CSV Logs (by
   default) or Audit Logs in the Data Source Settings page. Features
   such as Popularity, Top Users, Joins, Filters, and Lineage are driven
   by this data. For PostgreSQL data sources, Alation previously took
   into account only queries run in Compose. Now Alation can take
   advantage of query logs for a more comprehensive picture of usage.
-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from Salesforce Einstein
   Analytics. This can be configured by following the steps in the Add
   New BI Server page in Admin Settings. Due to limitations of the
   Salesforce APIs, Lineage is only available to datasets, and is
   unavailable between datasource and datatable. This feature is enabled
   by alation_conf Set the generic bi flag (if not already set)
   alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True Set the
   salesforce flag alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_salesforce_bi -s True
-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from Salesforce DB as a
   datasource, further expanding the array of datasources accessible
   through Alation. SObjects are extracted as tables, using Fields as
   columns. These are all extracted under one schema, "sobjects," and
   schema filtering has been disabled as a result. Also note that
   Compose, Sampling, and Usage data are disabled. Admin users can
   enable this feature through the UI by going to Settings > Admin
   Settings > Labs -> and toggling "Enable SFDC Database Type"
-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from IBM Cognos as a BI
   Server. In Admin Setting, Add New Bi Server, register a Business
   Intelligence Server IBM cognos Limitation: Usage stats are currently
   only supported when Cognos is configured to use Oracle or SQL Server
   database types to store usage This feature is enabled by alation_conf
   Set the generic bi flag alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True Set the cognos flag
   alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_cognos -s True
-  Alation now supports Azure SQL Datawarehouse as a data source In
   Settings, Add a new data source and choose Azure SQL DW as the
   Dbtype. This feature is enabled by toggling the following Labs
   Setting: Settings -> Admin Settings -> Labs -> Enable Azure SQL Data
   Warehouse Database Type
-  Support for Execution Engines has been improved. The Add Datasource
   wizard now allows adding "Presto" as a multi-catalog datasource. The
   previous support as a single Hive Catalog is supported through the
   datasource type "Presto on Hive". Existing Presto datasources will
   continue to work as a Presto on Hive single catalog data sources.
   This feature is enabled through a Labs Setting Settings -> Admin
   Settings -> Labs -> Enable Presto Database Type with multiple
   catalogs

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  NTP configuration is no longer a required part of the installation
   process for Alation.
-  Adding an initial Data Source is no longer a required part of the
   installation process for Alation.
-  Administrators can no longer configure Alation to authenticate with
   LDAP or SAML from the install wizard. This needs special setup and
   should be completed from the Authentication panel under Admin
   Settings after initial install completes.
-  The Deployment Command Center has been reorganized. There are now
   tabs for Datasources, Filesystems and BI Servers, which allow for
   quicker navigation to specific sources.
-  For Microstrategy users, with BI sources from before 4.16: There is
   now a process to copy Logical Metadata (titles, descriptions, etc.)
   into a new BI Server object, bringing these objects in line with any
   future BI servers. For details, see [zendesk link]
-  When cataloging a Microstrategy Server, Alation specifically looks
   for the "Public Folders" and "Reports" folders. These names can be
   customized on the settings page to match the names on the
   microstrategy server.
   This feature is available only when feature flag enable_generic_bi is
   set to True.
-  In Metadata Extraction settings for MicroStrategy and Cognos (speak
   to your Alation contact about enabling these features), admins will
   now find a "Selective Extraction" field where they may either include
   or exclude certain projects.
-  The File Systems Extraction Job History table is now paginated,
   reducing page load times for devices that see hundreds of Extraction
   Jobs.
-  For Hive + Kerberos users,
   When adding a Hive datasource, checking the "Use Kerberos" box now
   displays a text field to add your Hive Principal. This streamlines
   setup, as users previously had to either edit the URI after setup, or
   provide the entire JDBC URI at setup.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed a bug where Hive QLI did not support root HDFS path "/" to be
   set as the Log path from the QLI Settings page. Now, "/" value for
   HDFS path value will be correctly processed. 
-  HDFS Extraction is now more robust to Errors encountered during
   Extraction.
-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18.1 where Oracle Query Log Ingestion
   failed with error: "ORA-01843: not a valid month". Now Oracle Query
   Log Ingestion succeeds.
-  Addressed behavior introduced in 4.6.0 where Metadata Extraction for
   Greenplum and Postgres databases would omit tables which had a
   comment (in the source database) on one of their columns but no
   comment on the table itself. These tables are no longer skipped.
-  Fixed a bug where MicroStrategy extraction would fail if "Public
   Folders" and "Reports" objects are hidden (usually because shortcuts
   are exposed for them instead). Now Alation successfully extracts
   metadata for reports in those folders even when they're hidden.
-  For Tableau users, a bug was fixed where Tableau lineage could not
   always be established for dashboards with custom SQL. If the SQL
   contained '<' or '>' characters, they were escaped by Tableau in a
   way that could interfere with the Alation parsing, and prevent Alation
   from establishing a lineage connection to the tables mentioned in the
   query. Alation can now properly parse those queries and establish
   lineage.
-  Fixed a bug where Hive QLI did not support root HDFS path "/" to be
   set as the MR Folder HDFS Path from the QLI Settings page.
-  For SQL Server users with that choose to use XEvents for Query Log
   ingestion, there is no longer a prompt to define a table for query
   logs. This was a source of confusion and irrelevant work, as a user
   would have to define a table that the service account has access to.
-  Fixed a bug where Metadata Extraction would not complete if it
   received certain exceptions from Hive while requesting metadata about
   a schema. Now Metadata Extraction skips the schema and continues.
-  Fixed a bug where system schemas were being included in the catalog
   by default for the Sybase data source. Now system schemas in Sybase
   are excluded from metadata extraction by default. If system schemas
   are showing in your catalog from a previous extraction, you can clear
   them out by re-running metadata extraction after checking the
   checkbox for "Remove schemas from the catalog that are not captured
   by the lists below."
-  For users of Virtual Data Sources, the error reporting of the
   Metadata API has been improved. When a parsing failure occurs, the
   line number that caused the error is now reported.
-  Fixed a bug where Query Log Ingestion for Presto would fail if all
   the tables in a query were fully qualified (in this case, the log
   would omit the "schema" field). Now Query Log Ingestion should
   successfully parse those queries.
-  Fixed a bug where metadata extraction was slow and sometimes failed
   on Oracle schemas using certain features such as Packages or Types.
   Now Alation metadata extraction for those schemas is faster and more
   robust.
-  Fixed a bug during Metadata Extraction on Hive where a certain kind
   of failure to connect to the Thrift service would show an
   unintelligible error message. Now the error message clearly indicates
   that the thrift service could not be reached.
-  Fixed a bug where a Conversations sidebar would be nonsensically
   displayed on the Tableau Server Settings page. The sidebar is no
   longer displayed.

 

Release 4.20.1
-----------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Resolved an issue introduced in 4.20.0 where Compose scheduled
   queries at monthly, weekly, or daily intervals would fail to execute
   with an error about being outside the delay tolerance (could be
   addressed by lengthening the delay tolerance).  These schedules now
   work with the standard delay tolerance.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose results would sometimes not render
   until the user switched tabs and switched back.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest would not return a full
   list of matching objects when the data source has objects with
   uppercase characters in the name.  SmartSuggest should now show up to
   10 matching items, regardless of case.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest did not suggest tables
   in order of popularity.  Now SmartSuggest should suggest the most
   popular tables first.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Further improvements to Snowflake support.  Alation now supports
   metadata extraction, sampling, and Compose access for Snowflake Data
   Warehouse.  Query Log Ingestion is not yet supported.
-  Alation now supports nonstandard system home directory and shell for
   UNIX accounts used by Alation on the server.
