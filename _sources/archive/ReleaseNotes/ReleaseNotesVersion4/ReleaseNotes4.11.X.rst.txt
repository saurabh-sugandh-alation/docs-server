Release Notes 4.11.X
====================

Release 4.11.0
----------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **API to Trigger Table Extraction** We have added a new way for
   external tools to integrate with Alation. External tools can trigger
   Alation to sync a particular table from a data source into the
   Alation catalog, thereby creating or updating the catalog page for a
   table. The catalog is now up-to-date without needing to schedule
   frequent and expensive metadata extraction runs. **
   **
-  **Compose Query Import** External tools can now trigger a browser
   window to open Alation Compose with a new query pre-filled with SQL
   text. **
   **

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Ability to Search Columns Where Fields are Blank** In Advanced
   Search, we’ve added support for faceting to objects where a field is
   blank (or their value not set). **
   **
-  **Compose Performance** Compose is now more responsive rendering
   the results while executing a query.
-  **Compose Text Highlighting** Error highlighting in Compose is more
   specific in more cases.
-  **Multiple Databases in Netezza** For the Netezza data source type,
   we have added support in order to sync multiple databases into the
   catalog.
-  **Reduced License Warnings** Now license expiration warnings can be
   dismissed until the next day or renewal.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Lockout Access** If a user with a valid license tries to visit
   the /lockout/ screen, they will be redirected to the home screen. **
   **
-  **Hive Log Polling after User Restarts Browser** When using
   separate Compose connections per session, it is now possible to
   refresh Compose in the middle of a query run and receive results, as
   well as continue to stream the Hive progress log (if it exists). This
   has always worked for shared connections, but now works for separate
   connections as well (previously, refreshing would cause Compose to
   start a new connection, so it would not use the old connection where
   the query execution was running). **
   **
-  **Retain Hive Progress Log after Execution Errors -** Previously, the
   Hive progress log was saved and shown after refresh only if the query
   ended successfully. Now, the log for a Compose query execution is
   available after refreshing Compose, even if the execution ends in an
   error. **
   **
-  **Hive Progress Log On Execution Results Catalog Page -** The Hive
   progress log is now shown on the Catalog page for execution results
   so that it is visible when a result is shared with a colleague. **
   **
-  **Changes to Custom Template Fields In Search** **-** Now, removing a
   custom field from a Template updates Advanced Search to not show the
   field anymore, although it may take some time to update - at least
   ten minutes or longer. **
   **
-  **Navigating Filtered BI Reports** On some BI catalog pages, it was
   possible to click "next" and go beyond the last page of reports. Now,
   the "next" button is disabled when there are no more reports. **
   **
-  **Respecting Article Permissions when Editing Custom Fields** In
   4.0, we released a feature to choose what permission to give a user
   when sharing an article with them. However, users who received only
   view permission could still edit custom fields if the field
   permission permitted it. Now, users must have both edit permission on
   the article and the individual field to edit it. **
   **
-  **Article Text Indentation** Previously, text indenting was lost
   upon page refresh on our articles. Now, text indenting is saved. **
   **
-  **Removing Article Attachments** Fixed a bug where users with
   ‘Edit’ access could not remove attachments from an article. Now, they
   can remove them. **
   **
-  **Deleting an Article as a Non-Admin User** Fixed a bug where some
   non-admin users could not delete articles, posts, and conversations
   for which they have edit access. Now, users can delete if they have
   permission to edit. **
   **
-  **Copy-pasted @-mentions** Copy-and-pasting a @-mention properly
   updates all references to it; for example, changing the title of the
   referenced object will properly update the @-mention.  Previously,
   @-mentions entered with copy-and-paste were not updated. **
   **
-  **SAML Login for Usernames Longer than 30 Characters** Users can
   now log in to Alation with SAML usernames greater than 30 characters.
-  **Lineage Error** We now correctly count number of nodes displayed
   in Lineage, and add the node to view unseen tables or BI objects. **
   **
