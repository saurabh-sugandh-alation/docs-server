Release Notes V R3 (General Availability)
===========================================

Release V R3
------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alation was susceptible to outage when the services that connect to
   data sources hit memory limits in the Alation code itself or in third
   party driver code. Now, Alation can detect when such an issue occurs
   and automatically recover. For customers with a DataDog dashboard,
   the dashboard now tracks these failures and recoveries.
-  Alation now supports pre-formatted block device mount support where
   bind mounting is infeasible.
-  Alation Analytics (Beta) is a new analytical service that provides
   complete set of usage data for customers to measure the success and
   increase adoption of the data catalog. Customers can query usage
   information and the metadata cataloged in Alation. They can create
   their own reports, measure completion of stewardship programs and
   create gamification systems to encourage contribution to the catalog.
   The Alation Analytics feature flag must be turned on for the feature
   to function.
-  Custom fields on Datasource, Schema, and Attribute will show the
   change history. A clock icon has been added to each field that will
   take you to the change history which includes time, contents and
   author for each change. Note: 1. Detailed history will only be
   tracked until after the upgrade to this release, any changes before
   this release are not recorded. There will be one item in the history
   to indicate the state of the field at the time of the upgrade. 2.
   Tags and Flags are not included in this change. Only custom fields
   will show history.
-  New facets to Advanced Search to filter by objects that have a
   specific tag or flag have been added. There will now be two new
   facets, "Tagged With" and "Flag Types". These will appear after you
   have already chosen an object type to filter by and only if at least
   one of the results of your search have a tag or flag. The "Tagged
   With" facet will show a list of tags and choosing one will filter to
   only the objects that have that tag applied. The "Flag Types" facet
   will show a list of flag types (endorsement, warning, deprecation)
   and choosing one of those will filter to only objects that have at
   least one flag of that type. Existing objects that were tagged or
   flagged will be re-indexed before they are available in these new
   facets. This should happen automatically very shortly after the
   upgrade to VR3+.
-  Stewardship dashboard (beta) lets stewards see how well their area is
   curated and helps them prioritize the curation effort. Alation also
   introduce Curation Progress as a measure of how well a data object
   (schema, table, column) is documented/curated. The first version of
   the stewardship dashboard has two reports:
   - Curation progress report: Summary of how well the area is curated
   and also a way to prioritize the documentation effort based on
   popularity/usage of data objects (schema, tables, and columns)
   - Objects without stewards report: List of data objects that do not
   have stewards assigned, prioritized based on popularity/usage
   information and curation progress.

Admin Release Notes
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A new home page is available in Labs which provides quick links for
   common actions in the catalog, plus configurable sections for links
   to articles, tags, business intelligence reports, or searches. Please
   contact your Alation Customer Service Manager or Sales Engineer to
   help you configure this new home page.
-  Auto-titling algorithm can now be "taught" from users adding or
   updating titles on catalog pages. Those user-added titles are
   considered as feedback for the auto-titling algorithm in addition to
   all the ways to "teach" it that existed before: feedback from
   terms/titles added on the Lexicon page and frequency and patterns of
   words seen in the catalog. This feature is currently behind
   the ``enable_lexicon_user_feedback`` feature flag in
   alation_conf.
-  The catalog administrator can now manually trigger the Lexicon job to
   re-compute the auto-title guesses from the UI and can monitor the
   status of the job. This can be accessed by clicking the Settings
   link on the Lexicon page.
-  Alation now supports new user role: Catalog Admin and has access to
   general Alation catalog setup and customization, which includes the
   following:
   - Manage custom fields & custom templates
   - Manage field level view and edit permissions on catalog pages
   - Create and manage catalog sets
   - Manage and update lexicon
   - Manage glossaries
   The Admin user role is renamed to Server Admin. Server administrators
   have full access, including Alation configuration (Example: User
   management, authentication, and server monitoring).

Improvements

-  Previously, when you share articles and execution results with
   non-alation users, email was sent in plain text format. Now, email is
   sent as an Alation template. The layout of email notification for
   sharing both articles and Compose results has also been improved.
-  Users will now be notified by email if they are added or removed as a
   data source administrator for a data source.
-  For Alation administrator accounts, Tableau permission mirroring is
   applied to ensure that the administrator will only be able to see the
   to see Tableau reports/workbooks/data sources in Alation for which
   they have access.
-  Alation can now run on AWS Linux 2.
-  The dockerized Alation installation streams upgrade messages to
   installer.log.
-  SmartSuggest offers more than just auto-completion, it also
   proactively suggests SQL snippets based on usage patterns on your
   data. Previously, this caused users to accidentally insert
   suggestions when trying to insert a newline or tab. Now, the
   interaction is improved to avoid those accidental insertions. We hope
   this tweak will bring you the best of both worlds: proactive
   suggestions that will only be inserted when you want them.
   Note: You may have disabled "Eager Suggest" in Compose settings
   previously to avoid this problem. If you did, we recommend you to
   enable them again to see if you like it better. Let us know!
-  Custom Field Value Format page will no longer have three sections
   explaining format for three different APIs (Articles API, Find
   Objects by Custom Field API, Upload Logical Metadata API). Now, each
   of the API will have a separate page that explains the custom field
   format for that respective API. This new page can be accessed by
   clicking the custom field format links on each of the API
   documentation page.
-  Upload logical metadata API can now be used to update custom field
   values for API Resources and API Resource Fields.
-  Alation supports cataloging Databricks instances (version 4.6), which
   complies with the Apache Spark standard. Users will be able to add
   Databricks to alation, extract metadata, run queries on the
   Databricks cluster, sample data from Databricks. Alation also
   supports Lineage and Popularity by parsing and ingesting the
   Databricks query logs stored in Amazon S3.
-  iotop utility has been added to Alation. System administrators can
   now monitor disk I/O by process and print summary reports using this
   tool.
-  New option is added to disable permission enforcement from the
   settings page of Tableau Server.
-  The Tableau workbooks can now be sorted by popularity on the catalog
   page. Sorting by popularity is set as a default option.
-  Previously, the object equivalence page used to take 50 seconds to
   load. The page load time for object equivalence under admin settings
   has been improved and it now takes only three seconds.

Bug Fixes

-  Alation ensures that the backup folder exists before running backup.
   If the backup folder does not exist, Alation creates a new folder for
   backup. Alation updates the existing backup folder with the
   timestamp.
-  Previously, the query search page can execute the user-uploaded
   Javascript. Now, the script has enhanced security and the query
   search page will never execute the user-loaded Javascript.
-  Alation now supports Hive servers configured with Kerberos and HTTP
   transport mode. Previously, compose and profiling would fail when
   attempting to run them on Hive data sources in this configuration.
-  Users previously were unable to create Python UDFs in Compose because
   the white space between new lines for a single statement was not
   preserved. Compose has now been updated to preserve the formatting
   of the entire statement when query is sent to the database and
   properly interpret UDFs of languages that care about whitespace
   formatting.
-  Previously, large articles on the 'Getting started for analyst' used
   to overflow the container for Internet Explorer 10. This issue has
   been resolved and the content now appears inside the container.
-  When hovering over a TrustCheck highlight in Compose, you can now see
   if it was added by a catalog set.
-  Previously, when you add Sybase ASE as a data source, Kerberos
   connectivity was provided as a config option. Sybase ASE does not
   support Kerberos connectivity and the option has been removed.
-  Facet selection search has been improved to display valid results.
-  Use TLS parameter can now be configured from the Admin Settings >
   Email Server screen (Email Notification section). Previously, the
   Test & Save button would not properly pass the Use TLS parameter. If
   the test failed, it would not save the parameter.
-  Metadata extraction was failing for Greenplum due to a filter value
   in the metadata extraction query. To resolve this issue, the pattern
   to exclude the system schema has been corrected to ensure that user
   schema names with prefix "pg" do not get excluded during metadata
   extraction.
-  On the General Settings tab of the data source settings page, you can
   select which JDBC driver to use to connect to the data source.
   Previously, the end of the driver name was not seen because they were
   cut off. This made it impossible to pick the correct driver when two
   drivers have nearly the same name, but a different suffix without
   guessing and checking. Now, the dropdown selector should expand to
   show the full name for all the builtin drivers.
-  "SELECT INTO" statements written using SQL Server are now correctly
   categorized as CREATE statements. So, the following features will
   work correctly:

   1. Table level lineage from source to target table.
   2. The target table inside the SELECT INTO statement will immediately appear on the catalog page.

-  Previously, the insert date button would not bring up the calendar
   popover to insert a date in Compose desktop. Now, the insert date
   button works properly.
-  Previously, Article title containing unicode characters caused a 500
   error. Article titles can now contain unicode characters.
-  In 5.3.0, a bug was introduced that prevented users from being able
   to form new database connections from the query form screen. Now,
   users can connect properly from any query form.
-  Multi-picker field values on an article page were replaced with other
   picker/multi-picker field values when the 'Show Empty Fields' button
   was used. The fix now shows correct values for all multi-picker
   fields when the 'Show Empty Fields' button is used on an article
   page.
-  ArrayIndexOutofBounds exception error occurred when the number of
   reports to be fetched was set to zero under Extraction Settings in
   MicroStrategy. This has been resolved and the user now needs to set
   the number of reports greater than zero.
-  Previously, the Query search and Compose pages would fail to load in
   Safari private browsing mode due to a dependency on local storage
   browser feature support. Now, these pages load in Safari private
   browsing mode.
-  TrustCheck markers now update properly when commenting and
   uncommenting blocks of code with the comment shortcut.
-  Previously, resolution of partially qualified tables was failing for
   Query Log ingestion of Google BigQuery. Now, Alation can resolve
   partially qualified Table name that appear in queries collected from
   query log ingestion. The queries will appear in the tables' query
   history.
-  Previously, if a user deprecates an object, and then un-deprecates
   it, it is possible that the job to remove propagated flags completes
   before the job to propagate flags to descendants, causing propagated
   flags to persist. This issue has been resolved.
-  The Job Detail parameter in the job status dropdown on the
   sources/manage_settings page now shows the updated job state message.
   Previously, if a job failed, the job detail parameter would still
   show an outdated job running state.
-  For certain database types (Sybase ASE), analysis of the view
   definition could cause self loop in the lineage graph. This issue has
   been fixed where the view name was interpreted as a source table.
-  Previously, the time for scheduled queries always displayed the
   Pacific Time in Query Search. Now, the time displays the browser's
   time zone.
-  Previously, a 500 error would occur when you visit a deleted Catalog
   set page. This issue has been resolved. Now, 404 error occurs when
   you visit a deleted Catalog set page.
-  Previously, an error message " Value is too long for character type"
   occurred in metadata extraction when the table name was greater than
   1000 characters. This has been resolved. Alation can now ingest
   tables that have names bigger than 1000 characters.
-  Previously, Query aborted error occurred when user-defined column
   type queries were run in Compose for Oracle data source. This has
   been resolved. Queries can now be run for user-defined column type
   for Oracle data source.
-  Previously, the CHECK partition index was not getting ingested during
   metadata extraction for Teradata and the Query log ingestion was
   unable to parse it. This issue has been resolved. Alation parses the
   CHECK constraint now.
-  The version of the Data Source API in Alation V R2 omitted a field
   necessary to set up a data source with scheduled metadata extraction.
   Now the disable_auto_extraction field can be set to false to make
   extraction run.
-  Previously, Query aborted error occurred due to long insert SQL
   statement. This has been resolved and Alation recommends the length
   of the SQL statements to be less than 100k characters. Alation will
   not analyze SQL query larger than 100k characters to protect the Java
   process against out of memory situation.
-  Previously, the column order was not preserved when profiling was
   carried out for Teradata. This has now been resolved. Now, on the
   'Samples' tab of a table catalog page, the columns will appear in the
   order as they appear in the table definition.
-  When article was referenced (added as a custom field value) from
   other catalog pages, the article page load was extremely slow,
   sometimes causing a timeout. After this fix, articles that are
   referenced will load properly.
-  Previously, the "include" or "exclude" path could be incorrectly
   removed when it was edited for HDFS Filesystem. This issue has been
   resolved.
-  Inviting users to conversations about articles no longer throws 500
   error.
-  Conversation sidebar closes when navigating to catalog pages that do
   not support conversations, as opposed to being stuck in an open state
   with no content.
-  Previously, partitions were showing up as separate tables when
   metadata was extracted for Greenplum. This issue has been resolved.
-  Previously, if there are more than 100 catalog sets, only the first
   100 catalog sets were shown on the Catalog sets page. This issue has
   been resolved.
-  Now, 'select all' on a multi-picker field will select all the
   filtered options if any filter is on. When the multi-picker dropdown
   is closed, the filter clears.
-  Now, long source comments wrap inside the bounding box, instead of
   extending over.
-  Previously, the action of removing server admin themselves from the
   server admin group was not disabled in the UI of group object page.
   The group object page used the old object list component. Now, the
   Server admin cannot remove themselves from the server admin group.
   The old object list component has been replaced with new group member
   list component and is used in the groups page.
-  On the Labs tab of the admin settings, the label text appeared to be
   clickable, but it was not. Now, the style of the cursor when hovering
   over the label text indicates that it is not clickable.
-  The appearance of search results when searching for a filter value in
   Advanced Search has been improved. Previously, the results were
   spaced badly with large white space making them hard to read.
-  Previously, incremental metadata extraction(MDE) triggered from the
   insertion failed for a Kerberized impala data source. Incremental MDE
   now works as expected for the Kerberized Impala data source.
-  An issue in ingesting psql metadata was causing most column types to
   be displayed as N/A for Greenplum data source. This also caused
   failure in uploading data to table from Alation. This has been fixed.
-  Warnings upon query execution due to mandated filters and/or joins
   will now be generated dynamically to include mentions of either
   filters or joins depending on which are actually mandated.
   Previously, only the word "filters" was used even when joins were
   mandated, leading to confusion.
-  Scheduling information in query search results no longer incorrectly
   show the last run as having been successful following a schedule
   modification made since the last attempted scheduled run which
   actually had failed validation.
-  The Alation-setup tool provided via pip now provides more helpful and
   descriptive error messages and hints. This also ensures that the
   Alation query API python client now works on Python 2.6.
-  On running extraction for Cognos BI, some folders were not getting
   extracted previously. This issue is resolved and now all the
   folders/projects will appear on running extraction.
-  Previously, when the user had loaded a very long query into compose,
   upon returning to the home page, the compose query preview section
   would slow down drastically depending on how large the query was.
   This slow-down would affect the entire page and render the home-page
   unusable if the query was too big. Now, the query content becomes
   truncated in the preview window, cutting off at 5000 characters, at
   which point the user may simply click the window to open up the
   compose page to view the full contents.
-  ADLS metadata extraction was failing due to authentication type
   getting set to default (kerberos) on saving connection parameters.
   This issue has been resolved by adding an extra check to ensure
   authentication type is not updated on saving connection parameters.
-  Teradata datatype issue has been fixed. Previously, all datatypes
   except char and varchar were not displayed properly.
-  Currently, there are issues if a report contains more then one
   required prompt in Microstrategy, then, metadata cannot be extracted.
   This issue has been resolved and now, we are able to extract the
   metadata for these reports as well.
-  Previously, the connection timeout was 18000000 ms for Google Big
   Query and caused the code to keep running even if the connection was
   not formed. This made it difficult to locate the error. Now, if the
   connection takes more than 60 seconds to form, then, it will time out
   and connection will fail.
-  Previously, the test connection failed and metadata extraction failed
   when Salesforce was added as a data source. This issue has been
   resolved.
-  The Report link is now configurable when you extract reports in
   Microstrategy. The customer can provide the web server or load
   balancer name for the report URL re-direction. If the name is not
   provided, then, the default value (URI) specified in the URL is
   picked up. Alation now supports Java-based server for report URL.
-  Previously, the column datatype size was missing for tables created
   in Compose for Sybase ASE. This issue has been resolved and the
   column datatype size is now displayed.
-  Previously, indexes were not getting extracted for DB2 zOS
   datasource. This is resolved and now metadata extraction of schema
   can be done on the Settings page and indexes will also be extracted.
-  Deprecation propagation was re-enabled with v4.17. Before v4.17,
   there was a feature flag and only if it was turned on, the user can
   see propagated deprecation flags. In versions greater than 4.17, the
   feature flag itself was removed, and the flag propagation works
   automatically. A possible confusion that can happen is, if there are
   deprecation flags created before the update, their children will not
   have propagated flags, whereas new deprecation flags added after the
   update will get propagated to children. A migration has been added
   that propagates flags from those objects deprecated before Flag
   propagation feature was re-enabled.
-  Generic BI system, a unified framework to accommodate various BI
   server types, was built for v4.18 to enrich physical metadata
   extraction and to provide the Alation rich curating capabilities to BI
   sources. This has been hidden behind a feature flag, but now the flag
   is turned on by default, so that any new imported BI server of a
   supported type will use Generic BI system.To
   check if Microstrategy is supported by Generic BI system, check the
   one of the following URLs,

      - old Microstrategy url: ``<your home>/bi/microstrategy/<server_id>``
      - new Microstrategy url: ``<your home>/bi/gbm/server/<server_id>``

   This change is not applied to Tableau.
-  Alation has migrated datasource to LMS and datasource uses Mark as
   star value. To get the correct star value, is_faved_by method is
   replaced with Mark.is_marked method.
-  Previously, there was no space between Cancel and Save buttons to
   differentiate them as different buttons for custom fields in
   Articles. This issue has been resolved. Now, there is a space to
   differentiate between the Cancel and Save button.
-  Previously, expressions were not shown for reports extracted using
   Microstrategy. With this fix, the customer will be able to see the
   expressions for all the report measures.
-  For DB2, the columns were not displayed for tables created using
   Compose. This issue has been resolved. However, there is a
   limitation. The quoted schema or tables created using compose does
   not work.
-  Previously, the measure and dimension was not getting displayed for
   reports extracted using Microstrategy. This issue has been resolved.
   Now, the user will be able to see all the available measures of
   object prompt.
-  Data source cannot restore deleted data source on the data source
   settings page. Alation has now enabled Add/Remove/Update members
   action on deleted data source settings page and added some notice to
   let administrators know how to manage deleted data sources. The Data
   source administrator is able to restore deleted data source on the
   general settings page now.
-  Previously, some invalid SQL could cause Trust Check to show flags
   for a column in a different table than the one mentioned in the
   query. Now, when a column is used that does not appear in any
   mentioned tables, Trust Check will ignore it.
-  Previously, the glossary titles were truncated to a maximum of 20
   characters in the Glossary drop-down. This is changed and now the
   drop-down expands according to the length of the title.
-  Previously, the Completed Tasks tab of the Monitor page would not
   load for some instances of Alation. This could happen when a task
   name was missing. Now, even if a task name is missing, the UI will
   load and show the task name as 'unknown'.
-  Fixed a bug where the filter on Sites/Projects in Tableau Extraction
   would disappear.
-  While Alation administrator upgrades Alation or restore from backup,
   post version 5.3.0, users at times would see "unexpected EOF ..."
   errors in the \`installer.log`. These false positive errors would no
   longer be appearing in the log files.
-  Users of Google BigQuery can run long queries (up to five hours runtime)
   through Compose without timeout issue.
-  The style of dropdown with filtered search result in advanced search
   has been changed now. Previously, results were spaced badly between
   the result title and subtext. The space has been rearranged and the
   search result looks better now.
-  Fixed a bug where the auto-title was not displayed when clearing the
   existing title on a schema, table, or column.
-  Previously, if one drags and drops a file into an article while
   editing it, it was temporarily saved in a storage outside of Alation.
   Now these files are stored inside Alation. It is allowed to drag and
   drop files not larger than ALATION_MAX_UPLOADED_ATTACHMENT_FILE_BYTES
   size. This limitation is enforced now for images inserted into an
   article using corresponding widget.
-  Previously, there was a possibility that the job to propagate
   deprecation flags from the parent object to descendants crashes if a
   Compose query mentions the parent object, but such a mention is not
   correctly registered. This issue has been resolved.
-  Previously, when asked to title an object in Compose in the Dusk
   theme on Internet Explorer, the text in the text box was not visible.
   Now, it is visible.
-  Qubole and Teradata JDBC URI are different from the standard JDBC URI
   format dbtype://hostname:port/. From this release, you will be able
   to add Qubole and Teradata through CustomDB in Alation.
-  User defined column types can now be viewed in Compose for Oracle.
-  Previously, when you update an article with the bulk_metadata API,
   its "last_updated" would not change. This is fixed so that any change
   in the article's title or description/body using the bulk_metadata
   API would update its last_updated field.
-  The network connection check on the Tableau settings page has been
   resolved. For instance, if the URI uses HTTPS protocol, then the test
   checks against port 443.
-  "Refresh feature labs page after the requests of changing
   alation_conf value finished, but some flags' value are not updated
   correctly because the auto reload conf interval in Alation is 60
   seconds. To get the latest conf value, reload all conf since the conf
   value might get updated.
-  Previously, sorting worked only on title column in Glossaries. Now,
   sorting is applied to all the columns in the glossary, ordered from
   left to right.
-  Users will get \`Permission Denied\` warning while editing
   title/description on object catalog pages, if their permissions are
   revoked by admin at the same time. For updating title/description
   fields on object catalog pages, the "Edit"" button is deactivated for
   users not having edit permissions. So if the admin revokes permission
   of any user and that user does not refresh the object catalog page,
   they would still be able to edit the field. From now on, they would
   get \`Permission Denied\` warning instead."
-  Previously, Tableau workbook pagination used to break on servers
   behind improperly configured load balancers. Now, it should correctly
   paginate.
-  In version 5.5.0, a new bug is introduced causing Alation Analytics
   feature's database setup failure. This bug has been resolved and the
   database should now be available as soon as the labs flag is turned
   on.
-  Previously, public datasource browsing API (catalog API) returned
   tables/schemas/columns from deleted datasources in the API response.
   Datasource browsing API will no longer return objects from deleted
   datasources.
-  Previously, Data Source Settings Per-Object Parameters checkboxes
   were clickable even when changes were not yet saved. Now, checkboxes
   are disabled when changes to Per-Object Parameters are pending.
-  Previously, for certain types of objects (schema, table, filesystem,
   BI objects), saving a large text (longer than 2000 chars) to a Rich
   Text type custom field, either from UI or from API, could have caused
   500 error. This has now been resolved.
-  Error reporting for clicking Test and Save Email server settings has
   been improved. Previously, the Email server page would not load.
-  Previously, when a Data dictionary gets uploaded and an unexpected
   network error occurred, the user would see a blank green text box.
   This has been resolved. Now, a proper text message appears and asks
   the user to retry when the upload of Data dictionary is not
   successful.
-  In version before 5.4.5, profiling failed for Azure Data Warehouse.
   This has been resolved in version 5.4.5. Profiling is now supported
   for Azure Data Warehouse.
-  Previously, (versions before 5.4.5), the column profiling failed
   for SAS causing a null pointer exception to occur. This issue has
   been resolved in version 5.4.5 of Alation and the user can now
   successfully profile individual columns for SAS.
-  Previously, if you hit the next button on a page-able list of data
   and the request failed for some reason, you would not get any
   indication of the failure. Now, a message will pop up letting you
   know what went wrong.
-  On the Query Log ingestion (QLI) settings page of Presto, auto
   ingestion allows daily/weekly/monthly scheduling. Since Presto QLI
   reads from a cache that can be overwritten with a short life time,
   these options could be too coarse. So, Alation has changed this to
   hourly and daily scheduling.
-  Previously, 'Presto on Hive' data source threw an error when query
   was executed that requested a Decimal type column. Users can now
   profile and query for columns that are Decimal type.
-  Previously, when null values were present in a table and table
   profiling was performed, the null value distribution was not
   displayed on the table catalog page and column catalog page. This
   issue has been resolved and the null values are now displayed.
-  Previously, if a customer upgrades from earlier versions of Alation
   or v5.2 to v5.4.6 and higher versions, and has added a rich_text type
   custom field to the table and the length of the text exceeds 3000
   characters, then, the upgrade would fail. This has been resolved.
-  Previously, compose stopped functioning when the result had more than
   1000 columns. This has been resolved. Now, the query results that
   have more than 50 columns in compose make use of column pagination.

Known issues

-  SmartSuggest does not work for Databricks, since it is based on
   CustomDB.
-  Invalid SessionHandle errors occurs intermittently when Compose is
   run for Databricks.
-  Upload Data does not work for PostgresSQL and Databricks.
-  Column id# is displayed as '0' for all columns for Hive AWS Glue.
-  Alation migration will fail when there are huge amounts of objects in
   object equivalence.
-  After upgrading to Alation v5.4.6 and navigating to the Sources tab,
   the following error message " There was an error connecting to the
   server" occurs and connection to the data sources will fail.

Release 5.6.1
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  In version 5.6.0, a search on the Query Search page that would return
   results with at least one query associated with a data source with
   literal obfuscation turned on would hang and would not return results
   due to a server-side error. Now, such searches return results as
   expected.
-  Alation can now extract Tableau workbook and datasource created using
   Tableau 2018.
-  Previously, (version 5.4.1 to 5.4.6), users were unable to connect to
   SQL Server data source using NTLM authentication protocol. Despite
   using valid database credentials, the Service Account Test failed.
   This issue has been resolved.

Release 5.6.2
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  Previously, metadata extraction failed with an error serializing
   dbobjects when the data type was null for Oracle data source. This
   issue is now resolved.
-  Previously, custom picker fields would throw an error when unicode
   characters were added when configuring their values. Now, unicode
   characters in supported.
-  Alation now enforces Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
   signature validation to avoid potential privilege escalation attack
   in SAML authentication.
-  For administrators connecting to Hive, Alation now correctly handles
   Hadoop clusters configured for encrypted RPC calls. Previously,
   Alation connections would fail if "hadoop.rpc.protection" was set to
   anything beyond authentication.
-  Previously, there was a persistent XSS attack on the user profile
   page. This allowed a user with a valid Alation account to execute
   JavaScript in the browser of another Alation user. Any user with an
   Alation account could create an article and put a script tag in the
   title of that article. Anyone who browses to the user's profile page
   would trigger the execution of the script. The link to the page to
   trigger the script could be sent to other users. Now, the Article
   titles will not be executed on the user profile page.
-  Invitation is sent to users to participate in Alation user research
   testing as part of the NPS survey.
-  Previously, metrics and attributes were not getting extracted for
   reports using object prompts in Microstrategy. The report metadata
   now gets successfully extracted for Microstrategy reports
   using object prompt or hierarchy prompt.
-  Previously, the upgrade process from v5.0.3 to v5.4.7 of
   Alation could fail due to the migration of custom field data. The
   upgrade process from v5.0.3 to v5.4.7 is now successful.
-  Previously, the upgrade process may destroy customer dataset
   when /opt OR /opt/alation are symlinks. This issue is now
   resolved. All upgrades to V R3 release must use build 5.6.2 or above.

 

Release 5.6.3
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  Previously, the customers’ upgrade (version lower than 4.18 to higher
   version) might have failed during the migration of object
   equivalences to catalog sets if the object equivalence had huge
   amounts of objects (in the order of 100k) . This fix resolves the
   migration error.
-  The lineage for Tableau was incomplete for a workbook created using
   a  published data source. This issue has been resolved.
-  Previously, Tableau extraction would fail if exceptions contained
   unicode characters. This issue has been resolved.

 

Release 5.6.4
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  Previously, the HTTP REDIRECT binding method was only supported for
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication. Now, the
   HTTP REDIRECT and HTTP POST binding methods are supported for SAML
   authentication.

 

Release 5.6.5
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  Tableau data source certification is now supported for Tableau 2018.
-  Tableau workbook and data source badging is now supported for
   SSL-enabled Tableau Server.
-  Previously, Alation restore might fail due to the missing recovery
   Postgres file. This issue is now fixed.
-  Previously, Alation would ignore the Hive/Hadoop configuration.
   Alation will now read the "core-site.xml" and "hive-site.xml" files
   placed in "/opt/alation/site/site_data/pre_added_jars/".

 

Release 5.6.6
------------------

Bug Fixes

-  The Alation backend database has a default limit of 1G characters on
   the length of SQL query that can be run. Previously, the Metadata
   Extraction job used a single INSERT query which could grow over this
   limit and cause the job to crash. This issue has now been resolved.

-  Alation V R3 backup process did not respect the retention
   configuration settings. As a result, the backup disk might run out of
   space due to the large size of backup archive. This issue is now
   resolved.

| 7040                              | Fixed an issue where some users   |
|                                   | could not log in after update     |
| 9164                              | when using SAML SSO for           |
|                                   | authentication.                   |
| 9449                              | Alation recently added support    |
|                                   | for using HTTP POST binding with  |
|                                   | SAML SSO. All customers were      |
|                                   | previously using Redirect binding |
|                                   | because Alation did not support   |
|                                   | POST binding. Many configurations |
|                                   | allow for automatically selecting |
|                                   | POST binding if available. This   |
|                                   | caused existing instances to      |
|                                   | switch over and in some cases     |
|                                   | caused authentication failures    |
|                                   | blocking users from logging in.   |
|                                   | Now, Alation has changed SAML SSO |
|                                   | support to always force           |
|                                   | defaulting to Redirect binding.   |
|                                   | So existing installations         |
|                                   | integrated with SAML SSO should   |
|                                   | work in the same way they did     |
|                                   | before. Those customers wanting   |
|                                   | to use POST binding can change    |
|                                   | the configuration                 |
|                                   | ``alation.authentication          |
|                                   | .saml.force_redirect_binding``    |
|                                   | to ``False``.                     |

| 8086                              | For Hive users, the Data Uploader |
|                                   | will now work over Kerberos and   |
|                                   | HTTP Transport Mode. Previously,  |
|                                   | this combination would cause the  |
|                                   | Uploader to time out after 20     |
|                                   | minutes. Note that a valid        |
|                                   | WebHDFS endpoint must be provided |
|                                   | for this combination to           |
|                                   | work.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 9044                              | Fixed an issue where in some      |
|                                   | environments the replication      |
|                                   | service on the secondary server   |
|                                   | would not start. This prevented   |
|                                   | replication of configuration      |
|                                   | files. If your replication        |
|                                   | started without error this does   |
|                                   | not impact your installation.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
-----------------------------

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -  Fixed a bug where Compose queries against Kerberized Hive data     |
|    sources using HTTP transport would throw an error if the result    |
|    set was longer than 999 rows. Now, there is no limit on the result |
|    set so query execution will be successful for all rows in the set. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -  Fixed an issue where email integration would stop working on HA    |
|    Pair configuration after failing over to the secondary server. If  |
|    a customer was using a custom email integration instead of the     |
|    built-in email server and they failed over to the secondary        |
|    server, then users would no longer receive emails.                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -  Fixed an issue with offline usage data reporting where users       |
|    accessing Alation via the latest version of Google Chrome would    |
|    receive the "Unsupported Browser" error on Admin Settings >        |
|    Reporting > Upload Alternatives page. This no longer is the        |
|    case, and usage data can be successfully uploaded via the web      |
|    browser in any of the supported browsers.                          |

|                                   | Alation would not extract all     |
|                                   | available published data sources, |
|                                   | and if that happened, Lineage for |

|                                   | itself when the number of         |
|                                   | published data sources extracted  |
|                                   | by Alation did not match the      |
|                                   | number of all published data      |
|                                   | sources on the Tableau server     |
|                                   | (which was greater). Because of a |
|                                   | bug, Alation did not paginate     |
|                                   | through all available data        |
|                                   | sources. After this fix, if a     |
|                                   | workbook uses a published data    |
|                                   | source, it will be successfully   |
|                                   | extracted and displayed under the |

|                                   | would not save newly extracted    |
|                                   | permissions, which led to Tableau |

In order to assist with debugging, the Alation application writes
exceptions to log files. Alation’s codebase includes an open-source
third-party exception-logging library called Raven. We recently
discovered that Raven has an undocumented bug such that it sometimes
logs usernames and passwords stored in the application memory to the
Alation log files in cleartext.

In this patch we completely deactivate Raven.Originally,we included
the Raven capabilities into Alation to have the richest possible logs
for rapid issue resolution. Although without Raven certain issues may be
more difficult to diagnose, we will continue to have other logging
information. There are no plans on adding those exception-logging
capabilities back, presently; we will rely on other kinds of logs and
monitoring for diagnosis of issues.

It is of paramount importance that this security patch is installed by
all customers.

Note that this patch does NOT remove any of the existing logs
from your Alation instance. If you have not purged the existing logs as
part of the security bulletin recommendations, please consider doing so
after you install the patch. For instructions, see Section IV-B of
the security bulletin April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers.

 Release 5.6.11 - Security Patch

We have discovered that in certain scenarios, service account
credentials may have been logged in ``taskserver.log`` files. The details
have been described in our June 4, 2019 - Patch Alert/Security Bulletin: Data Source Credentials in taskserver.log Files. The patch fixes this logging problem.

Once you upgrade, please follow the instructions outlined in the
bulletin to delete any existing Taskserver logs from your Alation
instance.
