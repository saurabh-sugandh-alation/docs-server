Release Notes V R4 (General Availability)
===========================================

RELEASE 5.8.2 - GA
----------------------

Note that these Release Notes combine all features and bug fixes from
VR4 5.8.0 (Limited Availability) and up to 5.8.2 (General Availability).

New Features
------------

Improved MicroStrategy Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation has improved integration with MicroStrategy and now provides the
following:

#. The MicroStrategy directory structure is now visible when users view
   the dashboard or reports under a project. This helps to identify the
   source of the dashboard or report.
#. The Report or Dashboard fields will use terminology pertinent to the
   BI source. Report fields in MicroStrategy will be referred to as
   Metrics and Attributes. The terminology of Measures and Dimensions
   will be used for report fields for other BI tools.
#. The report metadata is successfully extracted for MicroStrategy
   reports created using object prompt or hierarchy prompt.
#. Metrics and Attributes extracted from MicroStrategy Servers now have
   their own catalog pages where the Description and Steward fields can
   be curated.

Inbox (Beta)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this Beta version, Alation users will be able to see conversation
updates and task notifications in their new Inbox. In addition to the
separate designated Inbox page accessible from the main toolbar, there
is My Inbox section on the Stewardship Dashboard. Granular details of
each conversation and the pertinent details are shown on the detailed
Inbox page. For more information,
see :doc:`Inbox </welcome/Conversations/index>`

Catalog Activity Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Stewards now have the ability to monitor curation changes to data
objects that they manage. Using the Catalog Activity report, they can
review updates to data objects, catch any inaccurate changes and restore
an older value if necessary. Catalog Activity report provides detailed
information about each change including the time of the change, the user
who made the change, and the actual modification that took place. Data
Stewards can utilize easy-to-use filters to zoom in and out of the data.
The Catalog Activity report is available as a personalized view for the
logged-in user on My Stewardship Dashboard and as a full view under the
Curate menu. The full-view report displays both curation changes and
physical metadata changes using two separate tabs. For more information,
see :doc:`Working with Catalog Activity Report </steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CatalogActivityReport>`

Agile Approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces Agile Approval: a new collaboration workflow
that allows catalog users to assign reviewers and request a review and
approval for an article from subject-matter experts in the
organization. Readers will be informed on the current review status of
the article (*Approved* or *Under Review*) on the article catalog
page. Agile Approval can be turned on and off in Labs.
For more information, see :doc:`Enrolling Articles Into Agile Approval </steward/ArticlesAndTags/EnrollArticlesintoAgileApproval>`.

Customizable Home Page (Beta)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is now a new fresh look for Home Page (Beta) featuring Revisit
and Object Windows. Revisit provides quick links to pages you recently
visited, starred or marked as Watched. Object Windows allows you to
preview articles, business intelligence reports, and dashboards
selected and promoted by your Catalog Admins as helpful and important.
Curated Content section has been improved and can now include links to
any Alation object type. Contact your Alation Customer Service
Manager or Sales Engineer to configure the Home Page.
For more information, see :doc:`Customizable Home Page </welcome/CatalogBasics/CustomizableHomePage>`

Query Version History (Beta)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries in Alation now have Version History. Every time you publish or
republish a query, Alation captures its new version. While viewing a
query in Compose, you can access Query Version History by clicking the
More dropdown and selecting Version History. The "publish" and
"republish" actions are available in Version History for queries you
authored; in addition, there is ability to restore an older version.
Versions in History are for now view-only. For more information,
see :doc:`Query Version History </analyst/DevelopQueries/QueryVersionHistory>`

Health Check in Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation now provides a UI for monitoring the health of its components
in order to determine whether they are running and working correctly.
Server Admins can view the status of these functional checks under
Health Checks in the Monitor section of the Admin Settings page.
For more information, see :doc:`Monitoring Component Health </admins/AdminSettings/MonitorComponentHealth>`.

Document Store Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation supports metadata extraction for MongoDB (Versions 3.2.10 and
3.6) as a data source. This can be configured by following the steps on
the Add New Data Source page in Admin Settings. Alation supports basic
and Kerberos authentication as well as SSL.

SAP HANA Calculation View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For SAP HANA Calculation Views, users will now be able to view lineage
and the View SQL definition.

BigQuery User Authentication Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation now supports user account authentication for Google BigQuery
data source. Compose and Dynamic Profiling will leverage this
authentication method whereas Metadata Extraction, Query Log Ingestion
and Standard Profiling will continue to use service account
authentication. This authentication method involves host and database
name. The host refers to the client email and database name refers to
the project ID.

Improved Custom DB Driver Support 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation has added the following new features for Custom DB:

#. Support has been added for extracting function and procedure metadata
   for data sources using DB Type *Custom DB*.
#. User can now use Kerberos authentication to connect to a datasource
   using DB Type *Custom DB*.
#. For a *Custom DB* datasource, users can select the Disable bulk
   extraction checkbox on the Metadata Extraction page to disable
   bulk extraction and iterate through tables individually. This should
   be used only when bulk extraction fails.
#. Alation now supports Query Log Ingestion (QLI) for table-based custom
   data sources. QLI will work only if query log history can be
   retrieved using a SQL query.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Catalog Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Previously, on Home Page, users were able to see all the tiles
   regardless of the access permissions for referenced objects. Now,
   Alation checks if the current user can see the tile object and
   filters out the ones for which they do not have the view permission.
-  The Undo and Redo buttons have been added to the text editor to
   facilitate editing of articles.
-  The rich text custom fields are now sorted alphabetically on the BI
   Server, BI Project, and BI Report catalog pages.
-  Rich text editors(Articles and Description) now support overflow and
   visibility CSS properties.
-  We have enabled HTML tag <map> and its attributes coords, shape,
   and usemap to allow users to add HTML <map> diagrams to rich text
   content in Alation.

Data Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Previously, the data source privacy message was available on the
   General tab of Data Source Settings. It has been removed from the
   General tab. The Access tab of the Data Source Settings now contains
   information on the data source privacy.
-  The dependency of AWS Glue metastore on Hive as a data source has
   been removed. Now, AWS Glue metastore can be added as a data source to
   Alation without providing the host/URI details.
-  Alation now supports metadata extraction from Data Definition
   Language (DDL) statements in Google BigQuery.
-  The Open With DataOS integration has been improved to allow third
   party applications to request configuration from each user.
-  Manual Catalog Sets and children metadata synchronization feature is
   now ON by default, for all users. Object Equivalences have been
   migrated to be included into Manual Sets.
-  Previously, the Field tab of the Tableau workbook listed only up to
   100 items, though there were more fields. This limit has  been
   withdrawn as support for pagination has now been added for measure
   and dimension tables of the Fields tab for BI Report, MicroStrategy
   Report, Tableau Workbook, and Tableau Sheet catalog pages.
-  Only the metadata of schema, tables, attributes, indexes, primary and
   foreign keys were extracted if a data source is added as Custom DB.
   Now, if the Custom DB contains procedure/function and the driver
   supports it, the corresponding metadata will be extracted.
-  Alation now supports Shared Access Signature as a new authentication
   type for Azure Blob Store data source.
-  Alation now supports extraction for SQL Server Reporting Service
   (SSRS) in Sharepoint integrated mode. The version of SSRS support
   includes 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2017.
-  Alation now has functionality to avoid the extraction of extended
   information during Query Log Ingestion (QLI) for Teradata. This
   significantly saves disk space and allows seamless functioning of
   automated QLI. This feature will not affect the default columns that
   are already shown on the QLI page.
-  Hive QLI now supports richer and more directive error messages
   intended to make error identification easier for users.
-  Considerably improved stability, speed, and extensibility for QLI on
   Hive data sources.
-  HDFS/ADLS connectivity issues with regard to incorrect host name,
   port and SSL for metadata extraction were previously not logged with
   sufficient detail. Now, additional log has been added to capture
   information on incorrect host name, port and SSL.

Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Deprecation flag propagation feature is now hooked to Flag public
   APIs. Adding DEPRECATION flags via POST API will propagate flags to
   the descendants. Removing DEPRECATION flags via DELETE API will
   delete propagated flags from the descendants.
-  Previously, if the user deprecated a data object (Example: Schema S
   got a deprecation flag on Alation, and its existing children got a
   propagated flag) and a child object is created (Example: Table T
   under Schema S) and metadata extraction is run on the data source,
   then the table T would not get a propagated flag. This issue is now
   resolved because the metadata extraction job finds and adds missing
   flags for new objects.
-  Previously, flag propagation could be kicked off only from RDBMS
   objects (Data Source, Schema, Table). Now it is extended to
   BI and File Systems, so that deprecating a BI object or a File
   System object will trigger propagation of flags to its descendants
   and any objects connected via lineage.
-  Previously, Find Objects by Custom Field API returned all the objects
   including the deleted ones. With this fix, it returns only the
   non-deleted objects unless the user passes "include_deleted=True".
-  If a user is suspended, a task is triggered that provides Edit access
   to the private articles of the suspended user to all admin users.
-  Alation now supports loading custom drivers from a directory. So,
   if a single driver needs to be loaded from multiple jar files, they
   can be placed in a single directory in the custom driver path.
-  The alation_conf will now write the PostgresSQL configuration
   parameter value in On/Off instead of the true/false boolean value.
-  If LDAP is enabled for any user, the DB account and the username
   should be the same. However, in the Top Users section on a catalog
   page, the Alation users and DB accounts were shown separately. Now,
   if LDAP is enabled, in Top Users, the DB accounts are mapped to the
   Alation users.
-  Previously, the HTTP REDIRECT binding method was only supported for
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication. Now, the
   HTTP REDIRECTandHTTP POSTbinding methods are supported for SAML
   authentication

UX Research
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Invitation is sent to users to participate in Alation user research
   testing as part of the NPS survey.

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. table::
   :widths: auto
   :class: longtable

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Fixed the issue of Kerberos authentication failing for Hive data   |
   |    sources when the first action after Alation restart was Metadata   |
   |    Extraction.                                                        |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  In V R3 (5.6.x), a search on the Query Search page that was        |
   |    expected to return results with at least one query associated with |
   |    a data source with literal obfuscation turned on could freeze and  |
   |    not return any results due to a server-side error. Now, such       |
   |    searches return results as expected.                               |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Alation has discovered a serious updater issue in V R3 builds      |
   |    below 5.6.2. In case */opt* or */opt/alation* were symlinks, the   |
   |    updater could potentially remove the dataset. This problem has     |
   |    been fixed. All updates to V R3 must only use builds 5.6.2 and     |
   |    above.                                                             |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, when a user entered multiple credentials for a         |
   |    connection URI across time, the scheduling dialog suggested old    |
   |    credentials instead of the recently used credentials. The default  |
   |    credentials pre-loaded when scheduling execution of a query in     |
   |    Compose are now the most recently used credentials for both the    |
   |    connection URI and the logged-in Alation user.                     |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, the Logical Metadata Service did not support unicode   |
   |    characters for Picker field and generated a 500 error. This issue  |
   |    has been resolved. Support has now been added for unicode          |
   |    characters in Picker and Multi-picker field options.               |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Resolved the issue of incorrect Group matching between left-hand   |
   |    navigation and the right-hand object viewer panel. Now, the viewer |
   |    panel correctly displays the Group as it is selected in the        |
   |    navigation. Also, Groups selected via quick search and @mention    |
   |    are displayed correctly after the page is reloaded.                |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |       -  It is now possible to use Command+click or Control+click to  |
   |          open a tile of the new Home Page in a new window.            |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, CREATE query statements containing columns of STRUCT   |
   |    datatype were not identified when running Metadata Extraction on   |
   |    Hive data sources. This issue has been resolved. Query Log         |
   |    Ingestion of Hive will also work for queries containing STRUCT     |
   |    keyword.                                                           |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Fixed the issue with Data Source Settings>Access tab loading after |
   |    a Group granted access to the data source is deleted from Alation. |
   |    The tab is no longer impacted by deletion of Groups and loads      |
   |    properly.                                                          |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, if a private data source had viewers, and the access   |
   |    was switched to public and then reverted back to private, it       |
   |    allowed the viewers to access the data source, but did not show    |
   |    them as Viewers on the Data Source Settings>Access page. This      |
   |    issue has been resolved. Now, the Data Source Settings page        |
   |    reflects the proper access settings.                               |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, the data source privacy message was displayed on the   |
   |    General tab of Data Source Settings. It has been removed from the  |
   |    General tab and now appears on the Access tab of the Data Source   |
   |    Settings.                                                          |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, each job sent a separate request to get the job        |
   |    status. Because the number of requests is directly proportional to |
   |    the number of data sources, the Sources>Manage Settings page could |
   |    take long to load. This issue has been resolved as the new job     |
   |    status API has been added to batch the job status as one request   |
   |    per page. As a result, the Manage Settings page loads much faster. |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, if the user hovered over Deprecated, Endorsed, or      |
   |    Warning identifiers, the Trust Check Peek was not shown in Compose |
   |    in IE 10. This issue has been resolved. The Trust Check Peek in    |
   |    Compose is now supported for IE10.                                 |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Alation did not extract metadata for columns from partitioned      |
   |    tables in Databricks. This issue is now resolved.                  |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  The new job status UI now provides an updated status of the job    |
   |    and shows that the job has failed for active jobs that             |
   |    unexpectedly crash. Previously, the job status would only show     |
   |    that the job was running.                                          |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, Alation Restore might fail due to missing recovery     |
   |    Postgres file. This issue is now fixed.                            |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Tableau Badging Workbook does not create duplicate projects when   |
   |    cognate is enabled.                                                |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Previously, Alation was unable to display all the schemas for      |
   |    Teradata data source. This issue has been fixed, and both user and |
   |    normal schemas will now be shown during metadata extraction.       |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  A query can now be scheduled to execute immediately if it has has  |
   |    never been scheduled. Previously, immediate execution of the query |
   |    would occur only upon updating a preexisting schedule. In both     |

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  The *alation_start* script will no longer start the local Postgres |
   |    instance for remote Postgres configuration.                        |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Compose Smart Suggest feature is enabled for Databricks and Custom |
   |    DB.                                                                |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  The *feature_flags.enable_mde_each_table_iteration* is now         |
   |    deprecated.                                                        |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  The standard users who were data source administrators of          |
   |    incompletely setup data sources were not able finish the setup and |
   |    a "Forbidden" message was shown. Now, the users are able to        |
   |    complete the data source setup.                                    |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  CREATE and INSERT statements written using Databricks are now      |
   |    categorized properly. The following features will now work:        |
   |                                                                       |
   |    -  Table level lineage from source to target table.                |

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Tableau web data connector that allows the user to set up the      |
   |    connection between Compose and Tableau via token is now            |
   |    functional.                                                        |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Standard users who are data source administrators of sources with  |
   |    incomplete setup will see the data sources in the Incomplete Setup |
   |    section of the Manage Settings page for a data source. Click the   |
   |    data source to navigate to the data source deployment page to      |
   |    complete the setup.                                                |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Fixed a bug where Compose queries against Kerberized Hive data     |
   |    sources using HTTP transport would throw an error if the result    |
   |    set was longer than 999 rows. Now, there is no limit on the result |
   |    set so query execution will be successful for all rows in the set. |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Fixed an issue where email integration would stop working on HA    |
   |    Pair configuration after failing over to the secondary server. If  |
   |    a customer was using a custom email integration instead of the     |
   |    built-in email server and they failed over to the secondary        |
   |    server, then users would no longer receive emails.                 |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | -  Added API documentation for the metadata import API for File       |
   |    System virtual data source. Now, the Alation Customer Portal has a |
   |    dedicated                                                          |

   | -  Previously, when a new data object was added to Alation, the       |
   |    "contains" column on the *Stewardship Dashboard* showed 0          |
   |    child objects even though the child objects did exist and when you |
   |    drilled down into this column, it would display these child object |
   |    records correctly. The issue has now been fixed, and the           |

RELEASE 5.8.5 - Security Patch
----------------------------------

This patch is a critical fix that addresses the security vulnerability
with logging which has been described in the recent Security bulletin:

-  April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers

Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to assist with debugging, the Alation application writes
exceptions to log files. Alation’s codebase includes an open-source
third-party exception-logging library called Raven. We recently
discovered that Raven has an undocumented bug such that it sometimes
logs usernames and passwords stored in the application memory to the
Alation log files in cleartext.

In this patch we completely deactivate Raven.Originally,we included
the Raven capabilities into Alation to have the richest possible logs
for rapid issue resolution. Although without Raven certain issues may be
more difficult to diagnose, we will continue to have other logging
information. There are no plans on adding those exception-logging
capabilities back, presently; we will rely on other kinds of logs and
monitoring for diagnosis of issues.

It is of paramount importance that this security patch is installed by
all customers.

Note that this patch does NOT remove any of the existing logs
from your Alation instance. If you have not purged the existing logs as
part of the security bulletin recommendations, please consider doing so
after you install the patch. For instructions, section IV-B, April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers.

RELEASE 5.8.6 - Security Patch
----------------------------------

We have discovered that in certain scenarios, service account
credentials may have been logged in *taskserver.log* files. The details
have been described in our June 4, 2019 - Patch Alert/Security Bulletin: Data Source Credentials in taskserver.log Files. The patch fixes this logging problem.

Once you upgrade, please follow the instructions outlined in the
bulletin to delete any existing Taskserver logs from your Alation
instance.
