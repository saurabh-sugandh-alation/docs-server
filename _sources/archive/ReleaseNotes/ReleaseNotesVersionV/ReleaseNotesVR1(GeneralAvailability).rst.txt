Release Notes V R1 (General Availability)
==============================================

Check out a high-level :doc:`overview </archive/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesVersionV/WhatsNewinAlationV>` of Alation V. For more comprehensive and detailed information, read on.

Release 5.0.0
--------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alation now provides a public API to interact with Articles. The API
   provides an interface for all CRUD operations, allowing for
   programmatic management of articles. For further details and code
   samples, refer to the `API documentation <https://developer.alation.com/dev>`__.

-  Alation now exposes a public API to get the database accounts that
   have queried an object. This information used to be exposed only in
   the Top Users field, and only for a certain number of users. The
   documentation for this feature can be found `here <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/queriers-apis>`__. 

-  Users of Advanced Search can now filter conversations based on
   whether or not there are responses, allowing for the rapid
   identification of any lingering questions or comments.

-  Users can now perform searches based on the contents of Rich Text
   fields. This is enabled for both quick and advanced search. Please
   note that after upgrading, it will likely take several hours to
   re-index objects and see this change come into effect.

-  Customize Catalog now includes a new Custom Field type: Multi-Select
   Picker. Similar to Picker, it provides a dropdown menu to select from
   predefined values, but with a checklist for multiple value
   selection. Advanced Search allows faceting by values in these fields.

-  On Table Catalog Pages for Hive Data Sources, Alation now shows a
   link in Properties to the Catalog page to the HDFS file or directory
   that backs the Hive Table. The HDFS File System must also be
   cataloged in Alation for this feature to work. On HDFS File System
   catalog pages, Alation now shows a link in Properties to the Catalog
   page to the Hive Table if this file backs the Hive Table. To enable
   this, the alation.feature_flags.enable_hive_links feature flag must
   be set to True.

-  Catalog sets now allow users to pick and choose specific
   objects(Datasource, Database Catalog, Schema, Table, Column) through
   the "Manual" set tab (accessible through Admin -> Catalog Sets). This
   is helpful when simple conditional rules can't express the group. In
   addition, users now have the ability to sync fields
   (title/description, custom fields, flags and tags) across the
   children of the manual set members. Once the manual set is created,
   the fields that have to be synced can fully be customized through the
   "Sync Children" tab on the catalog set page. This is useful when
   there are duplicate items (with the same name) across different
   schemas or datasources and fields would normally have to be copied
   manually to the duplicates. When syncing is enabled for the first
   time or the sync settings are modified, the metadata is copied from
   the children in the order of how their parents were added in the set.
   Metadata is synced across the children when one of the children is
   modified (through catalog UI / API / data dictionary upload). More
   details on how syncing works is present on the "Sync Children" tab.
   With Manual Catalog Sets enabled, Object Equivalence feature is
   deprecated, as Manual Catalog Sets support synchronization of tags,
   flags, and custom fields, in addition to title and description.
   Existing Schema Equivalences defined on the Object Equivalence tab in
   Admin Settings have been migrated to Schema Manual Catalog Sets with
   children syncing (for tables and columns) on title and description.
   Object Equivalence can still be used when Manual Catalog Sets is
   disables. As Object Equivalence is a deprecated feature, it will be
   removed from Alation in the near future. The new catalog set features
   can be enabled by \`alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_cognates -s True`. Any user can
   create/view manual sets but field synchronization settings can be
   enabled/modified only by admins.

-  For users of Compose, Trust Check is now available in conjunction
   with Compose Previews to trust the data they're querying. With Trust
   Check, flags added to the catalog are shown to the right users at the
   right time, so they have more impact with less effort. The data
   objects documented in the catalog are now brought forward in Compose
   through color coded highlights or underlines in the query text as you
   type. Users have control over the indicators in Compose. They can
   choose whether to get indicators for depreciations, warnings, and
   endorsements, or for objects without any quality flags.

-  For customers with Tableau Server 10.4 or later connected to Alation.
   Data Sources in Tableau will now be certified when the equivalent
   data source is endorsed in Alation. For Admins: Enable this feature
   by setting these two flags to True in alation_conf. Run these commands
   from the Alation Shell: alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_tableau_alation_integration -s True
   alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_tableau_certified_datasource - True

-  For Admins of PostgreSQL environments, Alation now supports Behavior
   I/O using EDB audit logs. To take advantage of this, enable Query Log
   Ingestion from a Postgres Data Source Settings page.

-  Alation now supports a Lineage GET API that will return a list of all
   relevant lineages for a given table key and table type. For details,
   refer to the `API documentation <https://developer.alation.com/dev/>`__.
   Note: The lineage results do not currently include query or script
   text for performance reasons.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _new-features-1:

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Alation now supports authentication with HttpFS or WebHDFS using
   kerberos with SSL encryption. This should enable QLI, HDFS
   extraction, and upload to HDFS functionality if your WebHDFS or
   HttpFS service is configured with kerberos and SSL. On QLI settings
   page, ensure the WebHDFS Server has the value like
   "https://YOUR_WEBHDFS_HOSTNAME" and that the port is correct. If
   there are self-signed certificates, those need to be imported into
   Alation. See installation guide for details on installing
   certificates.

-  Admin can now toggle feature flags on/off via a new feature flag
   admin page, reducing the need to use the alation shell. Changing
   flags will cause all users' pages to reload

-  Alation can now collect query logs for PostgreSQL data sources.
   Admins can configure Query Log Ingestion through CSV Logs (by
   default) or Audit Logs in the Data Source Settings page. Features
   such as Popularity, Top Users, Joins, Filters, and Lineage are driven
   by this data. For PostgreSQL data sources, Alation previously took
   into account only queries run in Compose. Now Alation can take
   advantage of query logs for a more comprehensive picture of usage.

-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from Salesforce Einstein
   Analytics. This can be configured by following the steps in the Add
   New BI Server page in Admin Settings. Due to limitations of the
   Salesforce APIs, Lineage is only available to datasets, and is
   unavailable between datasource and datatable. This feature is enabled
   by alation_conf Set the generic bi flag (if not already set)
   alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True Set the
   salesforce flag alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_salesforce_bi -s True

-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from Salesforce DB as a
   datasource, further expanding the array of datasources accessible
   through Alation. SObjects are extracted as tables, using Fields as
   columns. These are all extracted under one schema, "sobjects," and
   schema filtering has been disabled as a result. Also note that
   Compose, Sampling, and Usage data are disabled. Admin users can
   enable this feature through the UI by going to Settings > Admin
   Settings > Labs -> and toggling "Enable SFDC Database Type"

-  Alation now supports Metadata Extraction from IBM Cognos as a BI
   Server. In Admin Setting, Add New Bi Server, register a Business
   Intelligence Server IBM cognos Limitation: Usage stats are currently
   only supported when Cognos is configured to use Oracle or SQL Server
   database types to store usage This feature is enabled by alation_conf
   Set the generic bi flag alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True Set the cognos flag
   alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_cognos -s True

-  Alation now supports Azure SQL Data Warehouse as a data source. To
   use this feature, navigate to Settings, Add a new data source and
   choose Azure SQL DW as the DB type. This feature is enabled by
   toggling the following Labs Setting: Settings -> Admin Settings ->
   Labs -> Enable Azure SQL Data Warehouse Database Type

-  Support for Execution Engines has been improved. The Add Datasource
   wizard now allows adding "Presto" as a multi-catalog datasource. The
   previous support as a single Hive Catalog is supported through the
   datasource type "Presto on Hive". Existing Presto datasources will
   continue to work as a Presto on Hive single catalog data sources.
   This feature is enabled through a Labs Setting Settings -> Admin
   Settings -> Labs -> Enable Presto Database Type with multiple
   catalogs

-  For HDFS Users, Alation now supports the extraction of filesystem
   metadata from HDFS instances. Any distribution/version of HDFS that
   supports the WebHDFS REST protocol is supported. Path filters, along
   with connection and authentication parameters are specified in the
   settings page. The catalog pages for folders and files that match the
   path filters are displayed in the Alation UI.

-  For SAS DB Users, Alation now supports the extraction of metadata
   from SAS DB instances. To enable this, please run "alation_conf
   alation.feature_flag.enable_datasource_sas -s True" from the Alation
   shell.

-  For Cassandra users, Alation now supports cataloging Cassandra as a
   data source. Note that Compose and Query Log Ingestion is currently
   disabled. To use this, please run "alation_conf
   alation.feature_flags.enable_datasource_cassandra -s True" from the
   Alation shell.

-  For Users of Amazon S3, Alation now supports the cataloging of S3 as a
   Filesystem. Alation will display each S3 bucket as a hierarchy of
   directories and files representing the keys in S3. To use this, run "
   alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_filesystems -s True" from
   the Alation shell.

-  Alation BI Support has been reworked to accomidate a significantly
   wider array of tools. Currently, this framework supports
   Microstrategy, IBM Cognos, and Salesforce Einstein Analytics, but
   users can expect to see support for a wide array of BI solutions in
   future releases. To use this framework, turn on the feature flag by
   running "alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s
   True" from the Alation shell.

-  For SAP HANA users, Alation now supports the ingestion of SAP HANA
   Query logs.

Release 5.0.1
--------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  On Table Catalog Pages for Hive, Alation now shows a clickable link
   in Properties to the underlying location that backs the Hive Table
   for Amazon S3 (in 5.0.0 we released this for HDFS-backed tables). To enable
   this, the alation.feature_flags.enable_hive_links feature flag must
   be set to True.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Resolved an issue introduced in 4.20.0 where Compose scheduled
   queries at monthly, weekly, or daily intervals would fail to execute
   with an error about being outside the delay tolerance (could be
   addressed by lengthening the delay tolerance).  These schedules now
   work with the standard delay tolerance.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose results would sometimes not render
   until the user switched tabs and switched back.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest would not return a full
   list of matching objects when the data source has objects with
   uppercase characters in the name.  SmartSuggest should now show up to
   10 matching items, regardless of case.
-  Resolved an issue where Compose SmartSuggest did not suggest tables
   in order of popularity.  Now SmartSuggest should suggest the most
   popular tables first.
-  Fixed a bug where enabling "Tableau Data Source Certification" in the
   Labs admin tab only worked if Tableau Workbook Certification was also
   enabled from the backend. Now they can be enabled independently. Also
   added the option to enable "Tableau Workbook Certification" from the
   Labs tab.

Admin Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Further improvements to Snowflake support.  Alation now supports
   metadata extraction, sampling, and Compose access for Snowflake Data
   Warehouse.  Query Log Ingestion is not yet supported.
-  Alation now supports nonstandard system home directory and shell for
   UNIX accounts used by Alation on the server.

Release 5.0.2
--------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alation Installation no longer depends on the "which" command,
   allowing for installation on "minimal" Linux distributions.
-  Improved support for Tableau release 10.5.

 Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18 which would prevent the "Shared With
   Me" section of the Compose Query Browser from loading.
-  Fixed an issue with upgrades where very long table names would cause
   the underlying migrations to fail
-  Fixed an issue where Alation would strip all comments from scheduled
   queries and queries run through Excel Live Report. These comments
   could contain semantic content, such as hints to the database engine.
   Alation now sends the comments along with the query, but will not
   send them as a statement by themselves (i.e. a comment that is the
   last line in a query)
-  Fixed an issue where, in some enterprise environments, Alation was
   unable to provision linux system users with the right permissions in
   the Alation Shell environment, which would result in a failure during
   software upgrade. Alation will now check and reset the permissions if
   necessary.
-  Fixed a bug introduced in 4.18.0 where killing an in-progress Tableau
   Extraction or Virtual Data Source upload job would hide the status of
   any current or past jobs of that type. The actual jobs would continue
   to run on schedule, but not be visible in the settings pages. This
   could happen if the machine or server was restarted in the middle of
   one of these jobs or they were killed by the OS or a sysadmin. Now,
   current and past Tableau Extraction and Virtual Data Source upload
   jobs will show on settings pages.
-  This release disables a control for video uploads to the rich text
   editor (used in Articles). Previously, video files were being
   uploaded to an external website for staging purposes. We have
   verified that any uploaded videos were deleted from the external
   server shortly after upload. Users can continue to embed video from
   YouTube, Vimeo and other sources.

Release 5.0.3
--------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  For customers with Salesforce Einstein Analytics connected to
   Alation, Analytics dashboards will now be certified with a prefix
   when the equivalent dashboard is endorsed in Alation. If a user
   manually edits the title in Salesforce and removes the prefix, when
   the next metadata extraction job runs in Alation we will correct the
   title back. Users of Salesforce Einstein Analytics can enable this
   integration from Alation Labs. The service account associated with
   the Salesforce Einstein Analytics instance in Alation needs to have
   "Manage Dashboards" permissions in Salesforce for all the
   folders(shared, private, etc). When dashboards in Alation are
   endorsed, warned or deprecated we propagate the information to
   Salesforce Einstein Analytics as follows:

   -  If a dashboard has been marked as deprecated by at least a single
      user we will prefix (DO NOT USE) to the dashboard title in
      Salesforce.
   -  If a dashboard has not been deprecated or warned by anyone, and if
      it is endorsed by at least a single user we will prefix
      (CERTIFIED) to the dashboard title in Salesforce.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Dashboard titles for Salesforce in Alation will now synchronize with
   the corresponding titles on the Salesforce website.
-  Previously, the DataDog reporting agent was run by its own user. To
   improve the installation process, the DataDog agent is now run by the
   Alation user

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed an issue where, starting in 4.20, Alation would strip
   authentication information from the URI used for Hive/Impala QLI.
   This information is now properly passed to the server.
-  In some cases Microstrategy extraction would exhaust available memory
   before completion. Users can now disable permission mirroring as a
   workaround for this problem. Note that this a fix for a specific
   customer issue and not generally recommended to disable permission
   mirroring.
-  Fixed an issue where Impala QLI would fail while attempting to parse
   log files that have a slightly different timestamp format than
   expected. Alation is now able to handle the new timestamp format.
-  Fixed a bug where database identifiers that began with unicode
   characters would cause Metadata Extraction to fail.
-  Fixed a bug where upgrading to a higher version of alation with a
   lower build number would leave Alation in an inconsistent state.

Release 5.0.4
--------------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added metadata extraction support for SQL Server instances configured
   with case-sensitive collation.

Release 5.0.9
--------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Previously, Amazon S3 extraction worked if a folder is specified, but failed
   for full extraction. The recursion technique used in the call to S3
   for bucket objects has been replaced by the do-while loop. So,
   Alation can now support more than 10 million objects of a S3 bucket.
-  Previously, Alation would not be able to parse encrypted assertion
   when authenticating a user with SAML. Now, this has been resolved.
   SAML HTTP POST binding is not supported now.

Release 5.0.10
--------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  After upgrading to 5.0.8, NullPointerExceptions were occurring on
   running Microstrategy extraction for some projects with shortcut.
   This fix handles the exception and the extraction now runs
   successfully.
-  Metadata extraction was failing for Greenplum due to a filter value
   in the metadata extraction query. To resolve this issue, the pattern
   to exclude the system schema has been corrected to ensure that user
   schema names with prefix "pg" do not get excluded during metadata
   extraction.

Release 5.0.11
--------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Previously, the multi-picker fields on the article page were
   displaying wrong values on page refresh. This issue has been
   resolved. Now, the correct value of multi-picker fields is displayed
   on the article page on page refresh.

Release 5.0.12
--------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Previously, Alation Restore would fail when the recovery config file
   was not present. This issue is now fixed.
-  Alation has discovered a serious updater issue in V R1 builds below
   5.0.12. In case /opt or /opt/alation were symlinks, the updater could
   potentially remove the dataset. This problem has been fixed. All
   upgrades to V R1 must only use builds 5.0.12 and above.
-  Alation now enforces SAML signature validation to avoid potential
   privilege escalation attack in SAML authentication.
-  We used to have an issue when scripts could be injected into certain
   fields in Alation and then executed when users visited their User
   Profile page. This issue has been addressed and any injected script
   execution is no longer possible in Alation.
-  Previously, if the user drags and drops a file into an article while
   editing it, the file was temporarily saved outside Alation. Now,
   these files are stored inside Alation. The size of image inserted in
   an article should not exceed
   ALATION_MAX_UPLOADED_ATTACHMENT_FILE_BYTES size. This limitation is
   enforced now for images inserted into an article using the
   corresponding widget.
