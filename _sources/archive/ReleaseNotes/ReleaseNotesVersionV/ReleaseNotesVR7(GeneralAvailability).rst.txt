Release Notes V R7 (General Availability)
============================================

RELEASE 5.12.14
-----------------

Fixed the issue of the Lexicon job failing with an “overflow error” by introducing logic that can handle a critically large number of user feedback responses to the abbreviation-expansion matches suggested by Lexicon.

RELEASE 5.12.13
-----------------

- For Google BigQuery sources, fixed an issue with MDE and Profiling not working after changes to the service account setup. When a user account certificate was uploaded in addition to the service account and then deleted, MDE and Profiling became unavailable. This issue has now been fixed.

- Previously, with SAML authentication enabled, users whose account was inactive (suspended or pending activation) became caught in a redirection loop between their IdP and the Alation server when they tried to log in to Alation. Now, users with inactive accounts will be redirected to the **Inactive Users** page.

RELEASE 5.12.12
-----------------

- Previously, when one database was cataloged in Alation as multiple Data Sources, each of them containing different schemas from this database, and a BI object was sourced from database objects in different Data Sources, only one lineage diagram was displayed correctly, while others would display objects existing in Alation as TMP objects. This issue has now been fixed.

- Previously, Unicode characters in user display names caused an internal error in search indexing. As a result, Conversations assigned to users with Unicode characters in display names would not be indexed and attempts to navigate to them would result in an error. This has now been fixed.

RELEASE 5.12.11
-----------------

- Added ``alation.feature_flags.enabled_flash_plugin`` flag to the **alation_conf** utility. Setting it to ``False`` hides the Adobe Flash-dependent **Copy** and **Download** buttons from QLI Preview actions.

- Previously, Snowflake CREATE VIEW queries with COPY GRANTS keywords did not show up in the **View SQL** area and the Lineage diagram. Now, such queries will be displayed correctly.

- Optimized the data sources API to reduce the loading time of the Sources page.

- Fixed an issue where the use of the usage reporting feature (Admin Settings > Reporting) resulted in an incomplete usage data package and an error. After the fix, an admin can successfully upload usage metrics from the Alation instance.


RELEASE 5.12.10
-----------------

- Fixed the issue of email notifications not being sent to all users @-mentioned in a Conversation if multiple users were @-mentioned in one post.

- Added two configurable fields to the Settings page of **SSRS BI sources**:  **Report Server virtual directory** and **Report Manager virtual directory**. Previously, these parameters were not configurable and were always set to the default values of ``ReportServer`` and ``Reports``. Users can now configure these fields in Alation, which allows them to use the SSRS connector without changing the configuration on their SSRS server.

RELEASE 5.12.9
-----------------

- In Compose, for a new data source, when users clicked any of the **Run** buttons, Compose would not respond until the page was refreshed. This also caused the query auto-complete to not work. The fix ensures that the Run buttons and auto-complete work on the first try.

- Fixed a bug that had previously caused errors when the Stewardship Dashboard was loading due to missing data about some catalog object types.

RELEASE 5.12.8
-----------------

- Catalog representation of the struct data type for **Google BigQuery** has been improved to fully support struct composition.

- Fixed several issues with **extraction from Tableau sources**:

      - Fixed null pointer exceptions generated by a bad reconnection strategy when extracting from the Tableau Postgres database.

      - Fixed download timeout exceptions due to the download timeout not being respected.

      - Fixed null pointer exceptions caused by repository locations being identified by the View ID instead of the Sheet ID.

      - Fixed an issue caused by leftover ``Parameters`` data sources that Tableau does not clean up.

- Fixed an issue where lineage was not generated for **Snowflake** query statements ingested during QLI that contained a CREATE VIEW statement and the ``current_user`` function within the query.

- For **Snowflake** users, improved object resolution when parsing queries. Alation will now properly leverage database and schema information when resolving objects mentioned in queries using their unqualified names. This improves the capability to tie a ``mention`` in a query back to an object catalogued in Alation. Previously, unqualified names from Snowflake were resolved as temp objects, impacting popularity calculations and lineage.

- Fixed an issue where as the result of the regular **encryption key rotations**, the size of the **/data1/tmp** folder grew indefinitely. After this fix, the temp files that are created during key rotation are automatically cleared from **/tmp**.

- Fixed the issue where updating logical metadata values using the logical metadata public API did not work correctly when object names included mixed case (both uppercase and lowercase characters).

- Enhanced validation of SVG files that are uploaded for co-branding to preclude XSS and XSRF attacks.

- Enhanced application security by securing query titles.

- Enhanced application security by securing a number of pages that did not respect user page permissions.

RELEASE 5.12.7
----------------

This patch delivers the Alation product changes required to complete the migration of the Alation technical support operations to the new platform: Service Cloud.

Alation Zendesk Help Center, which was previously used by the Alation technical support to manage support requests from users, is going to be turned off on July 2, 2020 11:59 pm PST. After this time, if users try to raise a ticket using the Zendesk widget or click on any of the Zendesk Help Center links in Alation, they will receive an error message **until this patch is installed**.

**In this patch**:

- The Zendesk Support widget has been removed;

- Built-in links to Zendesk Help Center have been removed;

- The links to the Alation product documentation have been retargeted to the active product documentation site. Docs are available to all Alation users, and no additional configuration is required. See `Access Alation Product Docs`_ below.

- **Designated Service Cloud admin users** have the ability to contact Alation Support directly from Alation if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance. Your organization will inform all Alation users who your designated admins are.

- All users have the ability to access your internal help desk if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance.

If you are an Alation admin, then after this patch is applied, please make sure to perform the additional configuration to display links to the Service Cloud and your internal help desk:

- :doc:`Configure Service Cloud Access for Designated Admins </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/ConfigureServiceCloudAccessforDesignatedAdmins>`

- :doc:`Configure Access to the Internal Help Desk </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/ConfigureAccesstoInternalHelpDesk>`

Access Alation Product Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Visit Help Center link that takes you to the Docs site is available to all users and has no dependency on their Alation user role. To open the docs:

- In the Alation Catalog, open the **Information** menu from the main toolbar and click the **Visit Help Center** link:

      .. image:: ../../../_static/R7_visit_help_center1.png

- In Compose, click the **Help** menu on the top right and then click **Visit Help Center**.

      .. image:: ../../../_static/R7_visit_help_center2.png

Known Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking on a result link on the Search results page on the documentation site is incorrectly redirected to the login page of the hosting platform instead of the appropriate documentation topic. The Engineering team is working to resolve this issue in the short run.

   +======================+=================================================================================+
   | 16497                | Fixed an issue where QLI from a PostgreSQL source skipped query statements that |
   |                      | did not contain duration. Previous implementation of the QLI from PostgreSQL    |
   |                      | excluded such statements. After the fix, query statements without duration are  |
   |                      | ingested too.                                                                   |
   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 17807                | Fixed an issue with metadata extraction from Tableau sources (GBM V2) where     |
   |                      | Lineage was only partially calculated with a "missing attribute" error in logs. |
   |                      |                                                                                 |
   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the way Google BigQuery user certificates are stored on the server. They are now securely stored in the internal Postgres database in an encrypted format.

| 11171                | Fixed an issue where Tableau workbooks and projects were not displayed in the   |

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 15585                | Updated the Web Data Connector library to support Tableau 2020.x versions.      |
|                      | Before this upgrade, an attempt to use the Web Data Connector would throw an    |
| 15974                | error that the Web Data Connector library required an upgrade to the latest     |
|                      | version. This will no longer be the case.                                       |
| 16653                |                                                                                 |

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 16474                | The parse tree node traversal algorithm has been optimized to exponentially     |
|                      | reduce time taken to parse ingested queries. Query parsing occurs as the second |
| 16593                | stage of Query Log Ingestion (right after the ingestion phase). The issue would |
|                      | manifest itself as high CPU loads after QLI jobs launch and a long time taken   |
| 17061                | to complete QLI pipeline processing as parsing was bottlenecking the entire     |
|                      | QLI pipeline. This fix addresses performance issues stemming from parsing and   |
| 17187                | will reduce CPU load on Alation servers related to QLI jobs.                    |
|                      |                                                                                 |
| 17213                |                                                                                 |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 17034                | Previously, with the Viewer role feature enabled, Server Admins could           |
|                      | not delete article attachments, and Steward and Composer roles could not add    |
|                      | article attachments. This has been fixed: all roles except Viewer can delete    |
|                      | article attachments; Stewards and Composers can now add article attachments.    |

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Migration to V R7 failed for some customers with a serialization error. Fixed by updating the migration to not serialize the whole data objects into memory.
- Miscellaneous other fixes.

RELEASE 5.12.3
----------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File Systems Access Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File System Sources can now be made **Private**, which limits access to such sources for users without permissions. Private file system sources can only be viewed and discovered by users who are assigned as *Viewers* or *File System Admins* to this source.

*File System Admins* can be assigned to a **Public** file system source too. Only *File System Admins* can access the Settings page of a file system source, Public or Private. All catalog users can view the catalog pages of a Public file system source.

If the **Viewer** role is enforced in an instance, then only admin-level users (Server, Catalog, and Source Admins) can access the Settings page of a file system source and only when they are assigned as File System Admins to this source. See Access to File Systems.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some changes were made to the UI of the **License** and **Users** tabs in the Admin Settings based on the early release feedback from Alation users. Because the new system of licensing is not enforced in V R7 (5.12.x), the **License Type** column has been hidden from the **Licensed Users** table of the **Users** tab and reference to licenses was removed from the **Compare User Roles** info-box on the **License** tab.

   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 16340                | Added support for null values in Azure Blob Storage metadata. Previously,       |
   |                      | null values passed in the metadata might cause errors during metadata           |

   | 16633                | Fixed an issue with adding image data using the Article API: rich text values   |
   |                      | now accept such data as Base64-encoded images in the <img src=""> tag.          |
   |                      | Base64 images can also be added to the article Body field in the code mode      |

   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 16637                | Fixed the ability to use anchors in the Body field of articles, which allows    |
   |                      | users to create internal links to article sections. Anchors can be added using  |
   |                      | the <a href="#AnchorName"></a> and <a name="AnchorName"></a> HTML tags in the   |
   |                      | code view of the article Body field.                                            |
   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  16993               | In versions 5.12.0 to 5.12.2, when SAML authentication was configured on the    |
   |                      | Alation server, users with usernames longer than 30 characters found themselves |
   |  17166               | unable to log in to Alation. Now, this is fixed and users with long usernames   |
   |                      | can successfully log in.                                                        |
   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a known V R7 GA issue where users with the Viewer role had access to query forms on catalog pages of Query objects when the Viewer role was enforced. Now, access to query forms has been disabled for the Viewer role.
- Fixed a known V R7 GA issue where users with the Viewer role received an error message when changing the Alation password on the **User Profile** page. Now, the new password can be successfully saved.
- Fixed an issue where users with the Viewer role could see and click the Add Tag icon on catalog pages of dataflow and BI objects. Now, the **Add Tag** icon will appear as disabled for Viewers.
- Fixed a known V R7 GA issue where the **Add Stewards** icon on catalog pages of file system and API resource objects appeared as active for users with the Viewer role, although clicking it resulted in an "Insufficient Permissions" error. Now, the **Add Stewards** icon will be disabled for the Viewer role.
- Fixed a known V R7 GA issue where Date, Picker, and Multi-Picker custom fields on catalog pages of file system sources appeared as modifiable to users with the Viewer role, although an attempt to update the field resulted in an "Insufficient Permissions" error. Now, the Edit controls for these fields will appear as disabled to the Viewer role.
- Fixed a known V R7 GA issue where several custom fields on catalog pages of dataflow and BI objects would appear modifiable to users with the Viewer role. Now, all custom fields are displayed as read-only for Viewers.
- Miscellaneous other fixes as part of continuous effort to improve product quality.

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an issue where the **Author** column was not sortable in the Glossary table. Now, it is possible to sort the Glossary articles by **Author**.

RELEASE 5.12.1 - General Availability (GA)
----------------------------------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synonym extraction for Oracle and SQL Server sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added ability to enable synonym extraction for Oracle and SQL Server data sources. Synonyms will be automatically extracted during metadata extraction (MDE), and a dedicated catalog page will be created for each extracted synonym in the data catalog. For Oracle sources, both private and public synonym types can be extracted. Public synonyms will be located in the schema PUBLIC. Private synonyms are extracted with the schemas they exist in. For SQL Server sources, Alation extracts synonyms with their respective schemas. Synonyms inherit most of the functionality of Table objects: Popularity, Filters and Joins information, sampling, data dictionary, Trust Flags, and other features apply to synonyms too. Lineage and data upload are not supported. See Extracting Synonyms for details.

Improved Snowflake support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Updated the built-in driver for Snowflake data sources** to the new version (3.10.0) with enhanced support for parsing Compose queries and Snowflake query logs during QLI. The new driver version supports TLS 1.2 enabling connection to Snowflake after TLS 1.1 reaches EOL in the first half of 2020.

- Added **support for parsing CTE** (Common Table Expressions) during QLI from Snowflake data sources. As the result, the Filters, Joins, and Lineage tabs for Table objects will reflect the data resulting from parsing queries with CTE's during QLI. A known limitation is that some queries with complex CTE syntax may still not be parsed correctly during QLI (for example, queries that contain both RECURSIVE and UNION keywords).

- **QLI improvements** previously, QLI for Snowflake data sources was performed using the QUERY_HISTORY table function of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA which is limited to extracting a maximum of 10,000 query logs for the last seven days and is further optimized to fetch 10,000 query logs for the last 24 hours. This improvement introduces a new way to perform QLI: it is now possible to configure QLI to run on the QUERY_HISTORY view of the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema which does not have this limitation. For more information, see :doc:`Snowflake </datasources/AddDataSources/Snowflake>`.

- Added **JDBC URI support for Snowflake** data sources.

- Added ability to extract Snowflake view definition using SHOW VIEWS and GET_DDL commands

- Added support for stored procedures

- Various bug fixes, including fixing an issue with sampling for columns with binary data types and issues with the data upload functionality

GBM V2 APIs using Open API 3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released new Generic Business Intelligence Model (GBM) V2 APIs that allow creating, updating, and deleting catalog objects for virtual Business Intelligence (BI) sources, as well as reading catalog pages for both virtual and real BI sources. The GBM V2 APIs are described using the Open API 3.0 Specification (OAS). The RESTful operations supported by BI APIs will allow developers to build integrations to manage resources via a set of CRUD operations referring to Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PATCH) and Delete (DELETE). To enable the use of GBM V2 APIs, set to ``True`` the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation.feature_flags.enable_swagger``, and API documentation will be available at **<your_alation_instance_url>/openapi/gbmv2/**. See :doc:`GBM V2 APIs Overview </bisources/WorkwithBISources/GBMV2APIOverview>` for more details.

Customizable templates for Schema and Data Source pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added greater flexibility in customizing the templates of the Data Source and Schema catalog pages. You can now customize the layout and order of fields and custom field groupings.

Encryption key rotation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Encryption keys can now be rotated on demand on the new Admin Settings > Server Admin > Encryption Key Rotation page. Regular key rotation is a recommended practice to achieve compliance with data security requirements at organizations. See Encryption Key Rotation.

Elasticsearch upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Elasticsearch component of the Alation application has been upgraded to version 7.4 to take advantage of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. See :doc:`Elasticsearch Upgrade to 7.4 FAQ and Troubleshooting </installconfig/Update/UpgradeElasticsearchVR7>` for details.

License management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alation is transiting to a new licensing model with four types of "seats" for users: *Admin*, *Composer*, *Steward*, and *Viewer*. Each type of license is correlated with a user role in Alation; however, in this release license-based user limit is not enforced. Server Admins can monitor the current license seat consumption on the new Admin Settings > Server Admin > **License** page. See :doc:`License </admins/AdminSettings/License>`.

New system of user roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with V R7, there will be 6 user roles in Alation: *Server Admin*, *Catalog Admin*, *Source Admin*, *Composer*, *Steward*, and *Viewer*. The Standard User role that existed in previous releases is no longer present. If your instance is updated to V R7 (5.12.x) from a previous release, you will notice changes in role assignment where users who previously had the Standard User role will be automatically assigned one of the new roles: Source Admin, Composer, or Steward. All existing users will be able to continue using Alation with the same level of permissions as before despite the change in their role assignment. New users who sign up for an Alation account will be assigned the Viewer role by default. See :doc:`Roles Overview V R7 (5.12.x) </welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>`. Also see Managing Users V R7 (5.12.x) for changes in User Management UI.

Viewer role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

V R7 Introduces the new **Viewer** role: Viewers can browse the catalog, but no editing or creating of objects is allowed. Enforcement of the Viewer role is disabled by default and must be enabled using the dedicated feature flag.  See :doc:`Viewer Role </welcome/CatalogBasics/ViewerRole>`.

Lineage V2 diagram enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lineage V2 diagram has been enhanced with several new interactive features to enable you to explore lineage in depth:

- When lineage is complex, some of the data nodes may be truncated on the diagram and hidden under a collapsed node called **More nodes**. Now, you can interactively reveal the truncated nodes and display them on the diagram one by one.

- It is now possible to explore additional source and target lineage links of an object directly on the Lineage diagram by revealing additional upstream and downstream lineage links for each node. See :doc:`Reading the Lineage Diagram </sources/Lineage/ReadLineageV2Diagram>` for details.

Dataflow objects can be discovered using search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dataflow objects can now be discovered using search.

Glossary UI and UX improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improved user experience of the **Glossaries** section by implementing several changes to the look and feel of the tables holding glossary information:

- the **Author** column is now sortable
- added breadcrumbs for improved navigation
- columns containing People Sets values (such as Author or Experts) no longer display the avatar next to the user's name
- group titles have the Group icon next to them to indicate a Group object
- other UI fixes for a better user experience with Alation Glossaries.

New Search (Beta)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rolling out a completely redesigned search experience with the goal to boost search quality. The new search accommodates for reported issues, feedback, and enhancement requests Alation has received from its users. This is a BETA feature. To try it out, turn on the Enable Beta Search for all users feature flag in Admin Settings > Server Admin > **Labs**. This will reveal the Search BETA menu item under the Search menu on the main toolbar.

Data Source Certifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Confirmed support for:

- Tableau 2019.4, 2020.1
- Mongo DB 4.2 (as Custom DB with a CData driver)
- MicroStrategy Cloud 2019
- EMR 5.27
- CDH 6.3
- SQL Server 2019
- PostgreSQL 12
- AWS Databricks
- SSRS
- MySQL 8.0
- SAP HANA 2.0

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- All **Analytics Stewardship** features are now enabled by default, which includes My Stewardship Dashboard, Tasks and Inbox, Agile Approval, Curation Progress, Data Objects Without Stewards, and Catalog Activity. The **Curate** menu is now available on the main toolbar for users with the Steward hat providing quick access to the Stewardship features.

- Previously, clicking on **Deprecate and Warning trust flags** that a user has set before, would remove the deprecation or warning, and users often accidentally removed flags by clicking on the icons. Now, a confirmation dialog pops up before the deprecation or warning flag is removed.

- **Improved performance of the Inbox and Conversations** features, decreasing loading time from tens of seconds to seconds.

- To help you quickly identify the Alation version of an instance, the **Alation release number was added to the Alation logo**. You can also view the product version on the About this Instance page (accessible from the Information menu).

- Previously, Conversation sidebar for an object did not show the **Referring to** field for the **Mentioning This** field for expanded conversations. Now, the **Referring to** field will be displayed providing access to the other object where this given object is mentioned in a Conversation.

Lexicon
^^^^^^^^^^

Feedback users give to ALLIE on the catalog pages of data objects by confirming and rejecting auto-suggested titles will now be applied system-wide when Lexicon is recalculated, helping to improve subsequent guesses.

Data Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added ability to connect to the MongoDB data source without authentication. If the username of the service account you provide in Alation is just spaces and no other characters, then a non-authenticated connection will be established to the database.

Admin Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- As an admin for Alation, you can now specify a list of file extensions allowed as attachments in articles using the **alation_conf** How to configure a list of allowed file types for article attachments.

- TaskServer and Connector logs are now JSON formatted.

APIs
^^^^^^^

- Added support for id's of objects listed in the custom fields of an Article in data retrieved from the `Articles API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/article-overview>`__. The id will be listed for Object Set Field values, allowing lookups of the object on other Public APIs.

Additional Bug Fixes in GA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the full list of fixes, see Fixes Referenced by Support Tickets and Miscellaneous Other Fixes announced in 5.12.0 (LA).

Additional Fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed an issue where Conversation titles were unescaped in email notifications, allowing the HTML to be rendered in email messages that included these titles.
- Removed a potential BREACH attack vector from an Alation installation wizard screen.
- Multiple other fixes improving product quality and release stability.

Known Issues in GA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updating from an earlier version of V R2 (5.4.0 - 5.4.5) to V R7 will fail due to the absence of several internal changes required for this update that were added in 5.4.6. The update from 5.4.0 - 5.4.5 has to happen in two stages via one of the later versions: to V R2 **5.4.10** first and then to V R7 or to V R3/ V R4/ V R5/ V R6 first, and then to V R7.

- There may be issues with extraction from Cognos 11 where only a subset of reports in a project are extracted.

- There are some UI issues with the Upload Data feature where the existing tables may not be listed in the Tables popup and need to be found using the quick search in this pop-up.

- New users with the Viewer role will have to initially select a Hat, which does not change their catalog experience if the Viewer role is enforced.

- When the Viewer role is enforced, the non-admin users are not filtered out from the list of users who can potentially be assigned as Data Source Admins.  Although such users may be assigned as Data Source admins, they will not be able to access the data source settings as this requires them to be promoted to Source Admins.

- Custom fields of types Date, Multi-picker, and Picker are not disabled on filesystem catalog page for users with the Viewer role when the Viewer role is enforced (fixed in 5.12.3).

- Users with the Viewer role will receive the permission denied error after changing their password (fixed in 5.12.3).

- Users with the Viewer role still have access to query forms when the Viewer role is enforced (fixed in 5.12.3).

- Users with the Viewer role can edit the Steward field and any other custom fields for API Resource objects (fixed in 5.12.3).

- Custom fields are not disabled on Tableau catalog pages for the Viewer role when both the GBM V2 and the Viewer role enforcement are enabled (fixed in 5.12.3).

- For other known issues that still exist, see Known Issues identified for 5.12.0.

   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 13285                | Metadata extraction process was adding some inaccurate data to the table        |
   |                      | *metadatachangelog* in the internal Alation server database: this data          |

   |                      | with no changes; however, in the Alation catalog these tables and columns       |
   |                      | were still displayed as expected. Fixed this issue by adding a check to ignore  |
   |                      | all schemas with no changes from the metadatachangelog update query.            |
   +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   |                      | for this to take effect. This will take place automatically in V R7 in with the |

Miscellaneous Other Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- References to deleted BI Servers now show [GONE] to indicate that they have been deleted.
- Fixed a bug where Data Source rules for a Conditional Catalog Set would not reset to the original value when clicking Cancel.
- Fixed an issue where an option Abbreviations appeared instead of Columns when selecting a value in the Referring to field. Now the option Columns is available in this list.
- Removing automatic titling from a column object page no longer results in a JavaScript error.
- Fixed a bug where editing the URI or the metastore URI in Data Source settings could potentially result in metadata extraction running with errors or failing to run.
- Fixed a bug where Referring to on the Conversation catalog page would be blank when the object was untitled.
- Fixed a bug where creating a conversation on a Catalog Set page would throw an error.
- Previously, running the Lexicon job from the Lexicon Settings page could silently fail if the Catalog had no Data Sources. This change surfaces a message that warns that Data Sources must be added to the Catalog before Lexicon can be run.

- For PostgreSQL sources, QLI may skip some of the queries that were run in 3d party applications if in the query history view they are formatted in a specific way. For example, queries that are formatted to begin with the ``duration`` attribute and not with ``statement`` (``duration: 0.192 ms statement: select * from <table> where <column> =<value>``)- may be skipped.
- Advanced Search BI Server facet does not apply if you search for BI Folders in a specific BI Server.
