About the Documentation Archive
================================

Welcome to the Documentation Archive. This portion of the documentation describes features or processes that are no longer part of the supported product, but that still may be part of your working set if you are using an older version of Alation. If you find a topic here, you should consider upgrading to a newer, supported version of Alation, and you should also click the **Download PDF** button on any page of the Alation documentation to store the documentation for future use. Topics remain in the Documentation Archive for only a limited time, and may be removed as soon as the next major Alation release.
