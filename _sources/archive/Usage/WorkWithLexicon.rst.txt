Work with the Lexicon - Versions up to 2020.4.x
=======================================================

*Applies to releases before 2020.4.x*

**Server** and **Catalog Admins** can view all the matches between abbreviations and expansions registered in the Lexicon on the dedicated **Lexicon** page.

Access Lexicon
-------------------
See `Access Lexicon <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/WhatisLexicon.html#access-lexicon>`_.

Lexicon UI Tour
------------------

The initial Lexicon page on a fresh install will be empty:

.. image:: ../../_static/Lex_empty.png

This is because the Lexicon job that automatically fills the dictionary is scheduled to run weekly, on Sundays at 8 a.m. But you can also run the Lexicon job manually on demand: see :doc:`Run the Lexicon Job Manually <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/RunLexiconManually>`.

After the Lexicon job has run, the Settings > Catalog Admin > **Lexicon** page will display the list of all mappings between abbreviations found in the data object names and expansions that Alation has computed for the abbreviations:

.. note::

    Alation computes expansions using the text data it finds in your catalog as input to find possible expansions that are real words.

You can also upload your list of abbreviation-expansion matches into the Lexicon. Uploaded expansions will be added as confirmed by a user. See :doc:`Configure Lexicon Manually and Upload Lexicon <../../steward/AutoTitlingandLexicon/ConfigureLexiconManuallyandUpload>`.

Exploring Lexicon
---------------------

You can explore the Lexicon content using filtering and sorting.

Text Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To filter the Lexicon using natural language,

Type your filter text in the **Filter** field on the top right of the page and press Enter. The page will update to only display the abbreviations which fit the text you typed:

.. important::

      The text filter on the Lexicon page is case sensitive.

Functional Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can narrow down the focus even more by using the functional filters. The filter buttons are grouped into two sets. You can apply one filter from each grouping at a time, applying a combo of two filters to the list of abbreviations. For example: **Unconfirmed** and **Abbreviations**. You can also choose to apply one filter from any of these two groups:

- Confirmed or Unconfirmed

AND/OR

- Words or Abbreviations.

To apply a filter, click the filter button. It will appear as pressed and the list of abbreviations will be updated to only include entries that fit the selected filter.

*No filters selected*:

*Two filters selected, one from each grouping*:

Filters change the focus in the following way:

Confirmed
^^^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will only display the abbreviation-expansion matches confirmed by users. The ALLIE icon next to such matches will be green:

.. image:: ../../_static/Lex_workwith06.png

Unconfirmed
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will only display unconfirmed abbreviation-expansion matches and the abbreviations for which Alation was unable to compute an expansion. The ALLIE icon next to these matches will be either yellow or red.

.. note::

    The color depends on the confidence score assigned to the abbreviation-expansion match.

Words
^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will exclude the abbreviations that are not full words:

Abbreviations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applying this filter will exclude separate meaningful words and will only leave abbreviations and combined words that are not separate words:

.. image:: ../../_static/Lex_workwith09.png

When you apply two filters - one from each group - both will be applied. For example, **Confirmed** and **Words** will display separate words that are also confirmed by users.

Sorting
~~~~~~~~~~

The two sorting options are **alphabetically** and **by frequency**. The frequency option means the number of times the abbreviation was found in data object names:
