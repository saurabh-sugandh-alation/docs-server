Alation User Survey
=====================================================================

As you work with the Alation catalog, from time to time after you log
in, you will see a question box pop up asking you about your experience
with Alation:

Your feedback is important to team Alation. It helps us measure
satisfaction with the product and keeps us motivated to constantly
improve it. We are looking forward to hearing from you and
appreciate it when you find time to share your opinion. The score and
feedback you provide in this survey is used by our Analytical, Product,
and UX teams when they are researching ways for Alation to deliver more
value to its users.

After you give us a score in the initial dialog, we will request you to
(optionally) elaborate on why you have decided on that specific number:

You can optionally choose to share your email with us when you send
feedback. An Alation representative for your organization may
contact you for more details about your feedback, especially if you let
us know there is an area that has a potential for improvement.

If you have any concerns about giving your personal contact to Alation,
note that the email you provide here will only be used for
contacting you about feedback and is not stored in any internal
databases or used for any other purposes.Â
