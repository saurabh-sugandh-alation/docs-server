=====================================================================

*Applies to releases before V R4 (5.8.x)*

    .. note::

        In newer versions, the Catalog metadata changes are reflected in the **Catalog Activity Report**: :doc:`Working with the Catalog Activity Report <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/CatalogActivityReport>`.

The **Metadata Change Log** enables you to track and view changes in your
data over time. The page can be found under the **Data Steward** and
**Governance Officer** hats, by clicking **Track: Metadata Change Log**. :doc:`You can read more about hats here <../../steward/AnalyticsStewardship/StewardshipDashboard>`. You can
also access the page directly at ``<YourAlationURL>.com/govern/metadatachange_log/``.

All changes are sent as a digest email:

- Digest emails are sent once a week on Monday. This email will include
  only changes from the previous week if you are a Steward of the objects.
- A digest email includes only 20 schema changes and 20 table changes.
  The email also has a link to the Metadata Changes Log page with the
  full list of schema changes.
