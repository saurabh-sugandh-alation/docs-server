Add Tableau Sources on Legacy Framework
==============================================

*Applies to releases V R5 (5.9.x) - V R7 (5.12.x)*

Already existing Tableau sources continue to use the Legacy model unless you choose to migrate them to GBM V2.

This requires the role of the Server Admin.

To add a Tableau Server source to Alation,

#. Make sure you have the required information at hand. For details, see :doc:`Prerequisites for Adding a Tableau Source to Alation <../../bisources/AddTableauServer/PrerequisitesForAddingTableauSource>`.

#. Sign in to Alation as a Server Admin and on the main toolbar click **Sources** to open the sources page.

#. Follow the generic instruction in :doc:`Add a BI Server as a Source <../../bisources/AddBISources/AddingaBIServerasaSource>` until you are on the Settings page for your Tableau source.

#. Parameters in the **Server Connection** section of the Settings page will be inherited from the first setup step. You now need to provide the parameters for metadata extraction and lineage:

   .. tabularcolumns:: |p{5cm}|p{10cm}|

   .. table::
      :widths: auto
      :class: longtable

      **PostgreSQL Connection**

      Host                               Hostname for the Tableau
                                          PostgreSQL database

      Database Name                      Name of the Tableau PostgreSQL
                                          database. ``workgroup`` will be used
                                          by default.

      Port                               Port to connect to Tableau
                                          PostgreSQL database. **8060** will be
                                          used by default.

      Username and password              Service account credentials for
                                          Tableau PostgreSQL
                                          database. ``readonly`` is the default
                                          account.

      **Extraction Settings**

      Timeout                            Set a maximum time interval (in
                                          seconds) for Alation to extract a
                                          single preview item (for example,
                                          a thumbnail, a PNG or a CSV
                                          file). The default is 10s, which
                                          is usually enough time for
                                          successful extraction.

                                          If extracting a preview item
                                          takes longer than this timeout,
                                          Alation will drop the object and
                                          try to extract the next one.
                                          This prevents extraction from
                                          stalling because of a faulty
                                          object.

      **Selective Extraction**

      Number of Workbooks                The maximum number of workbooks
                                          to extract during a single
                                          extraction. This parameter helps
                                          to balance the load on the
                                          Tableau server during extraction.

      Extract High-Resolution Previews   Enable this parameter if you want
                                          to extract high-resolution
                                          previews. Extraction of
                                          high-res previews can demand more
                                          resources on the Tableau server.

                                          If this parameter is disabled,
                                          Alation will extract
                                          lower-resolution previews.

      Extract CSV Files                  Enable this parameter if you want
                                          the CSV files to be extracted.

                                          Some Tableau reports are created
                                          from source data in a CSV file.
                                          If such a file is extracted with
                                          the reports that use it as
                                          source, Alation can catalog
                                          the dimensions and measures used
                                          to generate these reports.

                                          Extracting CSV files
                                          can demand more resources on the
                                          Tableau server.

      Disable Permission Enforcement     Select this checkbox if you want
                                          the extracted Tableau metadata to
                                          be viewable by all Alation users
                                          without restriction.

                                          Clear this checkbox if you want
                                          Alation to respect the user
                                          permissions defined on the
                                          Tableau server. If you use
                                          this option, Alation will apply
                                          the same permissions that are
                                          assigned to the users on Tableau
                                          server. Only users who have
                                          access to objects on Tableau
                                          server will have access to the
                                          same objects metadata in Alation.

5. After you have specified the parameters for extraction, you can perform selective or full extraction from Tableau.

Full Extraction
-------------------

Full extraction from Tableau on Legacy model is a little different from
the Generic scenario: there is no toggle to enable selective extraction,
and Alation does not perform full extraction by default.

To perform full extraction,

#. On the **Settings** page, under **Extraction Settings/Selective Extraction**, click **Get List of Projects**.
#. Refresh the browser window.
#. Hover over the **Site/Project** title and click **Add+** on the right to view the list of the projects fetched.
#. From this list, select all the projects.

#. Click **Run Extraction Now** to begin extraction

Selective Extraction
----------------------------

Selective extraction from Tableau follows the generic scenario for all
BI Tools: see :ref:`Selective Extraction <Extracting_BI_Server_Metadata-Selective_Extraction>`.
