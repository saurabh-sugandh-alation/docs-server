Tables in Alation with Pivot
=====================================================================

.. note::

    This query is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**.

A table in Alation has a name, a title, a description, and some other
attributes. Each attribute is saved inÂ ``public.object_field_value``
(Object Field Value).

To display the attributes as columns in the result set we need to pivot
them.

.. code-block:: sql

    -- we want to see certain fields and values belonging to tables:
    SELECT
      object_url,
      MAX(CASE WHEN field_name = 'name' THEN text_value end) AS name,
      MAX(CASE WHEN field_name = 'title' THEN text_value end) AS title,
      MAX(
        CASE WHEN field_name = 'schema_original_name' THEN text_value end
      ) AS schema,
      MAX(
        CASE WHEN field_name = 'description' THEN text_value end
      ) AS description
    FROM
      public.object_field_value AS OFV
      JOIN public.object_field AS OF ON OFV.field_id = OF.field_id
      -- so we can use the field name
      JOIN public.alation_object_type as OT ON OT.object_type_id = OFV.object_type_id
      -- so we can use the object type by name JOIN public.field_value AS FV ON FV.value_fp  =OFV.value_fp
      -- so we can get the field value JOIN public.alation_object AS O ON O.object_uuid = OFV.object_uuid and O.object_type_id=OFV.object_type_id WHERE object_type_name = 'table'
      -- because the object_uuid is not global GROUP BY object_url;
