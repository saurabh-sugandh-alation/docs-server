=====================================================================

.. note::

    This query is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**.

This query shows how many people have logged in, joined, or have active accounts in Alation.Â 

.. note::

    The ``is_active`` column refers to whether or not their account
    was active (for example, it hasn't been suspended) based on the last time the
    ETL job ran that populated Alation Analytics.

     SELECT DISTINCT display_name, last_login, date_joined, is_active
     FROM public.alation_user
     ORDER BY last_login DESC;
