Analytics ETL on Demand
=====================================================================

.. note::

    This section is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**. Please see :doc:`Alation Analytics V2 </installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/index>` for information about Version 2 (available from release *2020.3*).

Alation Analytics ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is an automatic
process. However, you can trigger it manually on demand if the automatic
process fails and you need to troubleshoot it.

To trigger Alation Analytics ETL manually, SSH to the Alation host and
run the following script - from inside the Alation shell as user
``alation``:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo service alation shell
   sudo su alation
   cd /opt/alation/django
   ./alation_analytics/one_off_scripts/run_etl_jobs

This script will queue a background task to run the Alation Analytics
ETL job. Only run this script once so that only one Alation
Analytics ETL queued job exists at a time.

Any errors during the ETL will be logged in ``/opt/alation/site/logs/celery-alationanalytics_error.log``.

After the ETL job is completed, run metadata extraction on
your Alation Analytics data source to see the updated metadata.
