Alation Analytics UUID
=====================================================================

.. note::

    This section is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**.

Each Alation object has a so-called UUID.Â 

Because the UUID is a hex representation of the ID used internally,
it is not unique on the global level.

It only becomes unique if used together with ``object_type_id``.

That is why many joins join on ``UUID = UUID`` and
``object_type_id = object_type_id``.
