Specific Object Fields
=====================================================================

.. note::

    This query is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**.

For the given object, what are the values for each of the fields, as
seen in Alation Analytics. Mostly used to see how data in the catalog
will be seen in Alation Analytics. This query is parametrized.
It will require that you provide the object ID - you can obtain it from
the object URL in Alation. For example, in the
URLÂ ``https://alationtest.com/article/308/confirmed-activity``, the number
308 is the ID of the object (in this example, article).
