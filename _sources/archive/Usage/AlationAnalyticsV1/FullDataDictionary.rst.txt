Full Data Dictionary
=====================================================================

.. note::

    This query is for **Alation Analytics Version 1 (V1)**.

This query shows the parent objects for all objects of the types: column
-> table -> schema. The information comes
from  public.object_parent_relationship. The MAX function is used
because there is not first or any aggregate function.
