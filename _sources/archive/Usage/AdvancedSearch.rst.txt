Using Advanced Search
=====================================================================

With **Advanced Search**, you can find data using both natural language and
multiple filters which serve to narrow the focus down to specific
aspects of your catalog objects. For example, you can search
for *articles* having the word *query* where the *Subject
Matter Expert*  field value is *John Wane* and the  *Tagged
With*  field value is *Finance* .

To go to **Advanced Search**, click **Search** on the main toolbar and in
the menu click **Advanced Search**:

On the Advanced Search page, you can start with typing your search
criteria in the Search field on top of the page or/and with selecting
the type of catalog objects in the **Search for** row. You can
search in:

-  Data
-  API Resource Objects
-  BI
-  File System Objects
-  Code
-  Text
-  People

When you select a type of catalog object, the page will update to show
the catalog fields currently associated with the custom template for
this object type. After you have refined your search by applying
relevant filters, you will see a list of catalog objects which match
your selected criteria on the left. You can click the objects in this
list to view their catalog pages in the viewer area on the right:

To return to the initial Advanced Search page, click the data object
filter then click **Everything**:

Selecting Filter Values
-----------------------

You can select multiple built-in fields and multiple custom field values in Advanced Search. They will
be joined with AND logic:

When you select filters one by one, the search results will instantly
update to match all currently selected criteria.


.. note::

    In releases before V R6, you can select multiple built-in fields
    and only one custom field. In Alation UI, there is no way to
    differentiate built-in fields from the custom fields. When you select
    one additional custom field, the previously selected custom
    field will be automatically reset. However, the selected built-in
    fields will hold their values.


To reset a filter, click its name and in the dropdown that opens,
click **Clear**:

Known Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Rich text custom fields that have restricted viewing permissions
   will not be returned in the search results
-  For multi-picker fields, only one of the values for that field can be
   selected in each search

Displaying Hidden Objects
-------------------------

*Available from release V R6 (5.10.x)*

In your Advanced Search results, you can choose to surface the objects
that are marked *non-browsable* by Data Source Admins.


.. note::

    A non-browsable object is a data object that is hidden from the
    catalog and as a result cannot be discovered by browsing the data
    objects or using the quick search of the left-hand navigation panel.

    Data Source Admins can make objects *non-browsable* by clearing
    their Make Browsable settings on the Per-Object Parameters tab
    of the parent data source Settings page.

By default, the hidden objects will stay hidden. To reveal them in
advanced search, select the **Show hidden objects** checkbox on the
top right:

With this checkbox selected, the non-browsable objects in the catalog
will be surfaced in the search results.

Exporting Your Search Results
-----------------------------

*Available from release V R6 (5.10.x)*

You can download your advanced search results as a CSV file. Search
download is limited to 10,000 rows.

To export the result set,

On the Advanced Search page, click the **Export** button then
confirm the export. After the confirmation, an email with the export
download link will be sent to the email address provided in your user
profile:

    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

The output CSV file will be available for download for the next three days
but will be automatically deleted after this time.

Note that only 1 search export can be in progress at one time.
This means you will be able to trigger a second export only after the
first one is completed. If this happens, Alation will give you a
warning that the first export is still in progress. Try again later and exports should complete rather quickly.

How long does it take for the catalog changes to be reflected in search?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The changes to the catalog objects are reflected in search with a short
delay. Such changes as:

-  New values for custom fields
-  Changes using catalog sets
-  Changes to object properties (for example, **Make Browsable** property) -

will be surfaced in search only after the search index is updated.
Search index update is an automatic process that usually takes less than
10 minutes but may take up to 30 minutes to complete if a large
number of objects are affected by changes. That is why the search
results only surface the new data after a time: this is the time
required for the search index update to complete.
