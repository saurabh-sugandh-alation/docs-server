Naming Data with Lexicon
=====================================================================

*Applies to versions before V R3 (5.6.x)*

Lexicon is a nickname for the algorithm that assigns titles to tables
and columns. You must have an admin role to open the **Lexicon** page.

Releases before V R3 (5.6.x)
------------------------------

To access the library of learned titles, click the arrow next to
**Admin** then click **Lexicon**. Only admins have access to this page. 

As you can see in the figure below, the **Lexicon** page will allow you to filter table names according to,

1. Whether they are confirmed by a human or not
2. Whether the names are words or abbreviations 

and sort them,

3. Alphabetically 
4. by Frequency

After you have made changes on the Lexicon page, you need to propagate them across Alation.

Releases before V R3 (5.6.x)

Visiting the following link: ``<YourAlationURL>/lexicon/compute_lexicon``.

Weekly, Alation runs Lexicon and applies new titles. After you see that Lexicon has kicked off it can take up to an
hour to complete, depending on how much data you have. For most customers, it only take a few minutes to run.
