Customizable Homepage
=====================================================================

Versions V R4 (5.8.x) - V R7 (5.12.x)
----------------------------------------

Starting with *V R4 (5.8.x)*, Alation has introduced a new homepage. The old homepage only allowed minimal configuration, with two articles displayed prominently for Stewards and two different articles displayed for Analysts. Now, there is one homepage for all hats, but it allows to display many more articles and other Alation objects, both as tiles and as previews. The content on the homepage is based on the configuration file in the JSON format. If you want to update your homepage frequently, it may be worth having a scripted update mechanism.

This article gives a general overview of the three sections you can find on the Homepage in releases VR4 - VR7.

Promoted Actions Banner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section appears on the top and features shortcuts to the most
popular actions in Alation. From here, you can quickly reach the various
workflows of your catalog. It can include links to *Advanced
Search* with predefined filters or to *Compose* or to a
new *Article* editor to segue you directly into creating content.
There are alternative ways in Alation to navigate to these pages, but
these shortcuts will give you a boost!

This section is not personalized to individual users — the shortcuts are
the same for all.

Clicking on the *tiles* in this section will take you to the target page.

Revisit
~~~~~~~~~

This section is personalized based on behavior: it lists catalog pages
you have recently visited, "starred" or marked as "watched". It features
tabs:

-  **Visited** - displays recently visited catalog pages
-  **Starred** - displays starred pages
-  **Watching** - displays watched pages

The links to pages appear as clickable *tiles* .
In Revisit, the tile content corresponds to the selected tab. For
example, the  Starred  tab will display the pages you have
starred.

You can hover over a tile to reveal the description of the target page.
Click the tile to navigate there.

For details on starring and watching objects in Alation, refer
to :doc:`Classic User Experience </welcome/CatalogPages/ClassicExperience>`.

Curated by Your Admins

This section features content prepared by your *Catalog Admins* to be
shared with all users. It can include one or
more carousel and object window rows that have links to
promoted resources. You can click any of the tile elements to navigate
to the corresponding page.

*Curated by Your Admins - a Tile Carousel*:

An *object window* provides a read-only preview of the linked object,
that can be an article, a BI report, or a Tableau sheet. To navigate to
the dedicated page, click **Visit Page** in the top right corner of an
object window.

Permissions to View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some pages in Alation may be restricted by permissions, such as, for
example, private Articles or private Data Sources. This may impact the
content that is visible to the specific user on the Homepage: users
will not see previews or links to objects they do not have permission to
view.

If a user does not have permission to view a specific object,

-  Tiles linked to this object will be hidden from carousels for this
   user. If all tiles in a carousel are hidden from a user, this
   carousel will not appear on their Homepage.
-  The object window will be hidden from Homepage if a user does
   not have permissions to view the linked object.

Enabling the Homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customizable Homepage is not available by default and can be enabled by
*Server Admins* in **Labs**. For more details, refer to  :doc:`Configure the Homepage </archive/Usage/ConfigureHomePage>`.

Customizing the Homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To maximize the value for your Alation users, the new Homepage can be
customized in each instance of Alation.
