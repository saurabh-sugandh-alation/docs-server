How to Search
=====================================================================

Alation has deep search capabilities, which enable you to search broadly
across all of your data sources from one search bar, or narrow your
search.

You can search for almost any piece of data or information that lives in
Alation, including a column name, a BI report, a saved query, or a user.
To search for the data that lives in your tables, you must
query it.

You can search using natural language titles (for example, Top 100 Diagnosis
Related groups instead of ``Summ_top_drg``.) These natural titles are
added in several ways: ingested from existing data dictionaries,
manually entered by users, or suggested by Alation’s algorithms.

Help improve the query tool experience by adding titles where you don’t see
any or letting Alation know if its suggestion was right or wrong.
