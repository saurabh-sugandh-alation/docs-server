Searching and Filtering
=====================================================================

The Alation Sidebar enables you to search broadly across all content in
Alation or filter on specific types of Catalog content (schemas,
Articles, etc.).

The Search field at the top of the Sidebar enables you to search across
all of Alation. Search for logical table names, metadata, or Tableau
Dashboards. Use quotes around a search term to surface results
that match your search exactly.

If your search results are too broad or if you want to search only on a
specific type of Catalog object, you can facet your search by selecting
one of the options below the search bar.

Below the top search bar, Catalog is separated by object types. Click
Data, Articles, etc. to filter on a specific type of content.
