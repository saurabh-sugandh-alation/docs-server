Object Equivalences Tab
=====================================================================

Before *Alation V R6*, the **Object Equivalence** tab was
visible in Alation under the Server Admin settings. Now, this tab
is removed and users can no longer navigate to this page. 

.. note::

     The object equivalence feature  gradually became deprecated after in
     *V R1 (5.0.x)* Alation introduced the catalog set functionality. 

     Any existing equivalence relationships defined under **Object
     Equivalence** tab in prior releases are auto-migrated to
     **Catalog Admin** > **Catalog Sets**.
