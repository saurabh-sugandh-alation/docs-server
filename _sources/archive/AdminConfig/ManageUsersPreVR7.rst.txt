New Account Moderation
----------------------

If necessary, you can enable Admin approval for new user sign-ups in
the Account Policy section of the Users tab. If *moderation* of
new sign-ups is enabled, each new user has to be approved by a
Server Admin before they can log in. Server Admins will receive an email
notification when a new user has requested an account with Alation and
will proceed to confirm the new account.

To enable or disable sign-up moderation,

#. Sign in to Alation and in the upper-right corner of the application, click the Admin Settings icon. Admin Settings page will open.
#. In the Server Admin section, click **Users**.
#. In the Account Policy section, select to enable or clear to disable the **Moderate user signups** checkbox.

Pending Account Activation
--------------------------

To confirm new user accounts,

#. Sign in to Alation and in the upper-right corner of the application, click the Settings icon. Admin Settings page will open.
#. In the Server Admin section, click **Users**.
#. In the Pending Account Activation section, find the new sign-ups to be approved.
#. Click **Activate as...** to approve the new user and assign them a role in Alation or reject the new account by clicking **Reject**.

Approved users will be able to log in and start working in the scope
of the role assigned to them.

Rejected users will not be able to sign in.

Confirming Emails
-----------------

All new approved users will be requested to verify the email address
they provided at sign-up. Admins can monitor whether or not users have
done so in the **Email Confirmation** column of the **Named and Suspended
Users** table. Admins can bypass this requirement by
manually confirming the user's email address. To do so, click **Confirm
Email** for a specific user.

*Confirm Email*:

Promoting Users to Admin Level
------------------------------

On the Users tab, Server Admins can promote users to Server Admins or
Catalog Admins by placing them into the corresponding built-in Group.

To assign either the Server Admins or Catalog Admins role to a user,

#. Hover over the title **Members** to reveal the Add icon and click it to open the **Search Users** dialog. Find and add the user to the Group. The added user will be automatically assigned the role of either the Server Admin or the Catalog Admin - depending on which group you have opened.

table on the Users tab. To assign a role,

#. From the **Role** column, assign a role to the user by selecting a new value from the dropdown list.

Suspending Users
----------------

Note that there is no ability to *delete* a user from Alation.
Instead, a user must be *suspended* .

To suspend a user, assign the Suspended role to them. Suspended users
will not be able to log in to Alation.

The Alation objects that a suspended user created or contributed to will
remain in Alation and can be managed by Server Admins. The suspended
user will be marked as Inactive in their Profile and GONE if their name
is used in any of the fields.
