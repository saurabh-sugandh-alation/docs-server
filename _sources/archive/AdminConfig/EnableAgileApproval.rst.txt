Turning Agile Approval On
----------------------------

To enable Agile Approval,

Go to Admin Settings > **Labs** and toggle the Agile Approval switch on. The feature will now be available to users.

Agile Approval adds the following functionality to Articles in
Alation:

-  Ability to enroll each article into the Agile Approval workflow
-  Ability to assign Reviewers to articles by users with **Can Edit** level of access
-  Approval statuses **Requires Review** or **Approved** for articles enrolled in Agile Approval
-  Notifications on changes to articles and their status to Reviewers.


.. note::

 Turning on Agile Approval adds a field called **Reviewers** to the
 article template. If a custom field with the identical name already
 exists in your catalog, it is recommended that you rename your custom
 field to avoid confusion.


Turning Agile Approval Off
--------------------------

It is possible to turn Agile Approval off. Turning this feature
off will hide the corresponding functionality from Alation:

-  the Agile Approval workflow will not be available for individual articles
-  **Reviewers** field will be hidden from article pages
-  Review tasks will be removed from **Assigned to Me** in Inbox.
-  Agile Approval notifications in Inbox will be deactivated. 

If the feature is turned back on later, the functionality will be restored:

-  Articles which had Agile Approval turned on will have it back and
   will return to **Requires Review** status
-  Reviewers field will be restored on article catalog pages
-  New Review tasks will be sent to Reviewers’ Inbox
-  New notifications will be issued for articles requiring approval
