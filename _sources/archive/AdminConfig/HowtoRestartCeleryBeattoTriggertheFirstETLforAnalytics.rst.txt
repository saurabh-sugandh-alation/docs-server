How to Restart Celery-Beat to Trigger the First ETL for Analytics
=====================================================================

*Alation version V R4 (5.8.x)*

This is release V R4-specific instruction on triggering the first ETL
job for Alation Analytics.

V R4 has a known issue that the first Alation Analytics ETL will
not be triggered unless the ``celery-beat`` process on Alation server is
restarted. You will need ``sudo`` access to your Alation server.

To Work around This Known Issue
-------------------------------

1. After you enable Alation Analytics in **Labs**, enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo service alation shell

2. Run the celery-beat restart command:

    .. code-block:: bash

       alation_supervisor restart celery:celery-beat

The first Alation Analytics should be successfully triggered after the restart.
