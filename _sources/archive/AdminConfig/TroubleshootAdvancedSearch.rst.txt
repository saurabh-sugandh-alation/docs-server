Troubleshooting Advanced Search
=====================================================================

*Applies to release V R6 (5.10.x)*

Problem
~~~~~~~

After updating to V R6, :doc:`Using Advanced Search </archive/Usage/AdvancedSearch>` does not allow users to
select values for multiple custom fields.

Context
~~~~~~~

Starting with release *V R6 (5.10.x)*, users should be able to select
values from multiple custom field facets on the Advanced Search page to
better focus the search results (see :doc:`Using Advanced Search </archive/Usage/AdvancedSearch>` ). 

If you have updated Alation to V R6 from an older release, this
functionality will become available after the search index is updated on
your Alation instance.

The search index is expected to update automatically in the background
after updating to V R6. On instances with a large volume of catalog
data, this may take up to two days to complete. The same index update
process is triggered over the next weekend after the update as a backup
for the automatic run. After this update process has completed, users
will be able to select values for multiple custom fields in advanced
search.

Troubleshooting Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If after updating to V R6, you notice that advanced search does not
allow users to select values from multiple custom fields, the automatic
job *run_update_indexes_for_multi_cf* may have not run or not
completed.

You can check if the job has completed successfully by checking if a
file named *index_update_completed_file_for_multi_facet* exists at
**/opt/alation/site/site_data/**.

If the file *index_update_completed_file_for_multi_facet* does not
appear at **/opt/alation/site/site_data/** after several days
following the update, you can wait until the next weekend for the backup
job to run or you can troubleshoot by running this job manually from the
Alation shell.

To trigger the job manually,

1. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo service alation shell

2. Enter the Django shell

    .. code-block:: bash

       alation_django_shell

3. Run the following script:

    .. code-block:: bash

       from rosemeta.one_off_scripts.update_indexes_for_new_fields import run_update_indexes_for_multi_cf
       run_update_indexes_for_multi_cf.delay()

4. Exit both shells:

    .. code-block:: bash

       exit()
       exit

5. This job may take time. Upon completion, it creates an empty file *index_update_completed_file_for_multi_facet*. Check **/opt/alation/site/site_data/index_update_completed_file_for_multi_facet** to make sure the file now exists.

The functionality when advanced search allows for selecting multiple
custom field values should now be available on your instance.
