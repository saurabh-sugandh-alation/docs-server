Catalog Pages
==============

The fundamental unit of the data catalog is the *catalog page*. Catalog pages 
hold information about a company’s data assets, including
data objects, queries, BI content, and more. For each data asset, the 
catalog page includes a title, description, and fields for additional 
information. Most catalog pages have templates that can be customized with custom fields.

Catalog pages are the primary way that Alation conveys specific data
object information to its users. With Alation, information about data is
documented in one place, reducing the need to rely on institutional knowledge
for users to gain an understanding of their data sources.

Your data stewards can add important context to catalog pages by doing some or all of the following:

-  Documenting queries so new or inexperienced analysts can understand
   and re-run existing queries.
-  Curating data sets so that key resources are not asked the same
   question repeatedly.

Catalog pages have two main flavors: the :doc:`Classic User Experience </welcome/CatalogPages/ClassicExperience>` and the :doc:`New User Experience </welcome/CatalogPages/NewUserExperience>`. The new user experience is currently in Public Preview.
