New User Experience
====================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/Cloud_Label.rst

*Updated 12/21/2023*

What's New
----------

We have now moved into Public Preview II of the New User Experience! You will see detailed documentation throughout the page below, but the following list captures a summary of the major features and pages added since Public Preview I release.

- Data Source Hub
- Domains Hub and Details
- Search list view improvements
- Homepage basic features + Admin Guided User Interface (GUI)
- Query Page (without functionality to run the query in the catalog page)

See documentation for these features and pages added to the existing documentation below.

Overview
--------

Beginning with Alation release 2023.3.1.2, a new user experience is in Public Preview on select catalog pages. In order to participate in the New User Experience Public Preview, you must have Beta language contained in your contract or have a Beta addendum signed. Reach out to your Alation account manager for more information if you would like to access the Preview. 

You will have the choice of whether or not to enable this functionality, but you won't want to miss out on these benefits:

- Preview the exciting new next generation look and feel of Alation 
- Influence in-process development directly (we want to hear what you like and don't like!)

The following experiences will be visible once you turn on the New User Experience:

- Data Source Catalog Details page
- Schema Catalog Details page
- Table Catalog Details page
- Column Catalog Details page
- Catalog Navigation
- Search List View
- DataSource Hub
- Domains Hub and Details
- Homepage basic features + Admin Guided User Interface (GUI)
- Query Page (without functionality to run the query in the catalog page)

What Should You Expect and When Should You Expect It

Why Are Certain Pages Labeled "Currently Visible Experiences"?
---------------------------------------------------------------

We are taking the approach of prioritizing the most used pages, functionality, and user journeys first.

Definitions
------------

**Currently Visible Experiences:** Pages/experiences that are not blocked by an **Under Construction** page visual

**New features/functionality:** Features and functionality that have been added as part of the New User Experience Public Preview I or II

**Not yet complete features/functionality:** Features and functionality we plan to build a direct path to within the New User Experience but have not yet

**Removed features/functionality:** Features and functionality that we have learned are not particularly valuable in their current state:

- Utilize Classic app where these features are needed
- Please provide feedback if we have omitted functionality that supports a critical customer use case

Configuring Your Users' Experience
-----------------------------------

You will see three new :doc:`Feature Configuration </admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>` options in your Admin settings:

Flag 1: The **Enable Public Preview UI** flag defaults to **ON**, meaning any user that adjusts the Alation URL to add **/app** after **.com** will be able to experience the New UX/UI. You can easily switch this flag to **OFF** if you do not want your users to access this experience.

.. image:: ../../_static/Neodocs_EnablePublicPreview.png
    :class: with-border

Flag 2: The **Enable removability of 'Object defined fields'** flag defaults to **OFF**. If you would like to experience this new feature that is available as part of the New User Experience change this flag to **ON**. (Note: this also enables this functionality on Alation ‘Classic’). See :doc:`Edit Object Templates </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/EditingObjectTemplates>` for additional details on this flag and its use.

.. image:: ../../_static/Neodocs_EnableRemovabilityOfObjectDefinedFields.png
    :class: with-border

Flag 3: The **Enable the promotion of the Public Preview UI** flag defaults to **OFF**. If you would like your users to see a "promotion" message to help them more easily access the New User Experience, change this flag to **ON**:

.. image:: ../../_static/Neodocs_EnablePromotionOfPublicPreviewUI.png
    :class: with-border

The "promotion" message will look like the below (full view on the left and collapsed view on the right), and will show up on any Catalog page that is "currently visible."

.. image:: ../../_static/Neodocs_PromotionalMessage.png
    :class: with-border
  
Your users will always be able to revert back to the Alation ‘Classic’ experience at any time via 1 of 2 banners that will show up at the bottom of each page within the New User Experience.

Summary of New Features, Not Yet Complete Features, and Removed Functionality
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes new features and functionality available in the New User Experience, together with features and functionality not yet complete for the Public Preview, and functionality that previously existed but has been removed from the New User Experience.

The summary begins with three tables showing new features, not yet complete features, and removed functionality common across multiple pages. A fourth table lists known bugs. These tables are followed by sections showing comparison screenshots of the Classic page versus the New User Experience page for each of the Currently Visible Pages and calling out new features, not yet complete features, and removed functionality specific to the individual page. Additional sections describe changes to the Search, Navigation, and Homepage functionality.

- Hub pages will be accessible by clicking on the specific hub name in the left-side navigation (not the upper right corner **App** menu, as that does not exist in the New User Experience).

New Features/Functionality:

- Increased customization options

  - Ability to optionally remove all fields including the Search banner (which leaves the Search bar still available via the app frame)

  - Ability to add Custom Link fields and Object Previews (including Article previews)

- Easy-to-use Guided User Interface (GUI) available for Homepage configuration (JSON is no longer the only configuration option, but it is still an available option)

  - Note: Homepages NOT configured in the New User Experience will be denoted as **Legacy** and you will still be able to edit and use them in the New User Experience as desired

Not yet complete features/functionality:

- Other new features such as Collections, which would enable users to create lists of objects within Alation and pin those lists to their homepage. They can keep these lists private or share with others, helping all Alation users to jump back into their work quickly. 
- Ability to move features around on the Homepage

Removed features/functionality:

- Leaderboard

The Alation team will review and provide feedback to improve the experience. All statuses will adopt their standard meaning except:

- **On the Roadmap** means we will plan to address within the General Availability timeframe or as a fast follow.
- **Future Consideration** means we will consider in the future but it will not be part of General Availability.
- If a suggestion is not under consideration for this initiative, the idea will be moved into a different Category, OR, if it will not be considered across any Category, it will be listed as **Not Under Consideration**.

What User-Requested Changes Have Been Integrated into the New UX or Added to the Roadmap?

Private Preview Customer and Alation Employee Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Process:** During Previews, customers provide feedback via multipe methods. All feedback was recorded and triaged regularly. The most common and impactful updates within scope of the new user experience were **Completed** or **Added to the Roadmap of the New User Experience**. 17 ideas were deemed **not under consideration** due to lack of demand or impact or out of scope of this project. One feature originally planned, markdown capability in the Rich Text Editor, has been **Removed from scope**.

**Completed (9):**

- In-line edit of **Description** column on the Column table*
- Want **View** to show up as the label next to the Table icon if the object is a View and not a Table
- Improve the Trust flag modal design to ensure there were no inadvertent deletions*
- Want the Column table on the Table page to auto-adjust in size to show more or less rows without scrolling within the table*
- Want to see more rows in the Column Table on the Table page and have that row selection stick for the individual across all Table pages\*
- If a user paginates to page 2 of results in the Column Table on the Table page, clicks on a Column object and goes to that page, then selects **Back**, user is dropped back on the 2nd page of results*
- Wanted a full view of the table to default to showing all rows*
- Ability to remove **Samples** from the the Table template and still have **Columns** show
- If a user sorts by **Title** paginates to page 2 of results in the Column Table on the Table page, clicks on a Column object and goes to that page, then selects **Back**, the results are still sorted by **Title**\*
- Reduced the space between filters in the Search filter section

\* Implemented across all objects where relevant

**On the New User Experience Roadmap (9):**

- User-set width of columns within the Column Table should "stick" across a full session\*
- Enable users to add and rearrange Custom fields as columns in the Column table on the Table page and allow users to edit custom fields in-line or in a modal on the page in question
- Enable admins to set the default columns and order of columns in the Column table on the Table page
- Enable users to add **Source Comments** as columns on the Column Table on the Table page\*
- Enable certain fields to be moveable left and right that currently cannot be moved left and right (Data Policies (backreference), Properties, Source Comments, Domains, Tags)\*
- Improved filtering on the **@ mention** picklist for quicker navigation\*
- Presence of the **Sample** tab on the Table page should be controlled by the configuration of **Sampling** vs the visual configuration templates
- Make it more obvious when SQL is collapsed
- Improve experience---full text does not show in **samples** when long

\* Implemented across all objects where relevant

**Removed from Scope**

- Markdown capability in the Rich Text Editor

  Why removed? Upon further investigation, the available solution did not meet expectations. Implementing a solution to meet expectations would require a level of effort significantly greater than the level of customer demand. This feature has been added to the features to be considered in the future.

Issues Where Previous Settings and the New UX May Conflict
-----------------------------------------------------------

- You may not see all new Rich Text Field features if you have adjusted your Rich Text Defaults in the past---if you are not seeing Rich Text Field features you expect to please :doc:`update your allowed HTML styles </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/UpdateAllowedHTMLStyles>`.
