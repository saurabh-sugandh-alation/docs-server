Write Articles to Retain Institutional Knowledge
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Articles are Alation’s method to house information that is broadly
relevant for Alation users and a complement to catalog pages which hold
information specific to a particular data object. Articles have free
text fields that have ample space to describe a topic thoroughly, as
well as custom fields that add discrete pieces of information, such as
people, dates, or any other sort of classification. These custom fields
provide additional content for articles while also helping to narrow
searches for relevant articles.

Articles are important because they are a permanent, accessible, and
searchable store of information about a company’s data. Unlike other
legacy stores of information, articles are in the context of data, so
users don’t have to switch applications to get the information they
need. Also, the articles can be linked to data objects they are relevant
to so that they are always current.

To learn more about how to create articles in Alation, see  :doc:`Working With Articles </steward/ArticlesAndTags/WorkwithArticles>`.

Some of the ways we have seen customers use articles:

-  Presenting the company’s data strategy
-  Documenting governance policies, such as how to handle PII
-  Defining KPIs and key business terms
-  Onboarding topics and tutorials
-  Presenting detailed discussions of results of analysis, including
   links to data sets, queries, and dashboards

Best Practice #1: Consider information needs from the users’ perspective
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alation curators should understand and segment their user base and
create content required for each segment. Some example user segments
could include data scientists, analysts, or data stewards. Other
segments could be experienced or novice analysts, or, perhaps, analysts
in various functional areas, such as sales, marketing, or supply chain.

For each segment the Alation curator should understand what information
a typical user needs to do their work. For instance, one pharmaceutical
company’s analysts needed to understand milestones for clinical trials
by region, which they defined in articles.

Users often make their information needs known by asking questions of
key resources either using messaging software or by face-to-face meetings.
These questions that have general interest are good topics for
documenting in articles so time can be saved for both questioner and
answerer through self-service. Plus, unlike traditional methods,
answers documented in articles will be available for use in the future.

As Alation instances are populated, curators should understand any
content gaps that exist for each user segment and fill them with
relevant articles that will live in Alation. As curators create articles
in Alation they should consider these questions: 

-  What is the purpose of the article you are creating?
-  In what way will it help users understand a particular topic?
-  What is the most relevant and important information that users need
   to know about a particular subject? (Keep it concise!)
-  Think about how you want to organize articles so they are clear and
   easy to understand.

Best Practice #2: Create templates for articles that belong together
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Templates have customizable fields that make groups of articles
easier to find and their content easier to understand. Curators should
group articles that logically belong together and create templates for
each group. Examples of groupings of topics might include data policies,
onboarding tutorials, or KPIs for each geographic region or product
line. For each grouping, the curator should work with stakeholders to
define the template for the grouping. 

The custom fields in templates can make articles easier to find in
search and help focus results in advanced search. For example, each
onboarding article could have a field indicating its functional area,
so analysts in marketing, sales, or supply chain could enter the search
term to find tutorials relevant to them.

After the article is found, the custom fields of the template will
have information that is relevant to the topic being described in the
article. For instance, the onboarding articles may all have 30-60-90
days plans that can be fully described using a free-text field. KPIs,
on the other hand, may have fields for term definition, approvals, and
region codes.

Best Practice #3: Summarize articles in glossaries for easy reference
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alation has the feature for displaying selected fields for articles that
share a template in a Glossary form. Curators should consider which
information would be useful for users to see summarized in a glossary.
The type of information that is suitable for a glossary is usually where
there are many members of a group and a high-level summary is useful.
For example, an organization may have hundreds of acronyms related to
data. Users could reference a glossary to understand what acronyms stand
for then click the underlying article if they wanted more
details.

Best Practice #4: Make it easier to find articles using taxonomy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As users explore information, they will usually start at a high-level
and drill deeper as they learn and look for more detailed information.
Alation supports grouping topics that have a parent-child relationship
so that if a topic logically falls under another topic, it can be
designated as the "child". After the relationship is defined, child
articles will be shown underneath parent articles in the Taxonomy view,
facilitating guided navigation. They are flexible, allowing for any
number of sub-categories.

Best Practice #5: Consolidate existing content from disparate sources
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before they deployed Alation, the majority of our customers had multiple
sources of information about their data. One pharmaceutical company said
that before Alation, their environment was like a "cesspool" with
important information being kept in multiple, disparate sources,
including cloud-based documents, corporate intranets, and slide
presentations. With information in so many sources, users are likely to
miss critical data or give up in frustration.

Admins should survey all existing sources of information and consolidate
relevant and accurate articles in Alation. Curators should be asking the
same questions as with new content when this information is brought into
Alation.

Best Practice #6: Create gold standard articles as a model for others
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After curators have decided on their target audience and useful topics,
it is time to begin writing articles that will serve as models for the
rest of the data community. We have some customers who have employed
technical writers to begin the process of article creation. Although
this is an excellent practice, most organizations will not have such
resources available. However, typically there are members of the core
team that are eager to share content they have created previously or
write new articles that serve a clear need. These users should create
"gold standard" articles that employ best practices described here. The
particulars of what constitutes a "gold standard" will vary by industry
and organization, but the goals of knowledge documentation and
collaboration are similar everywhere.

Best Practice #7: Determine who can and should author articles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After an initial set of gold standard articles are published, additional
authors should be recruited. Determining who can write articles will be
dependent on the organization’s view of data democratization. At
Alation, we recommend keeping access to data as open as possible to
encourage contribution and collaboration among the entire data
community. In our view, this holds for both article authorship and data
object curation. We would encourage all members of the community to
write articles on topics that they know particularly well and that
generate a lot of questions. They should follow the guidelines in this
document to ensure that articles are necessary, properly structured,
included in the appropriate templates, and not redundant.

As a control on article authorship, curators may consider including a
form of workflow into articles. They could include a custom field that
would indicate that the article was reviewed and approved. The field
itself can be access protected. With this approach the knowledge of the
entire community can be collected while maintaining quality standards.

Best Practice #8: Link articles to other parts of the data catalog
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most powerful features of articles is the ability to embed
any other object that is cataloged in Alation using @-mention. For
example, users can see an expandable, live preview of the data object
that the article is referencing. Additionally, when users go directly to
that data object they can see articles that are linked to it, which they
can access to get additional information about the data object they are
viewing.

Best Practice #9: Avoid creating redundant articles
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As existing documentation is brought into Alation, admins should be
careful to eliminate any redundant content. 

-  SEARCH the catalog to see what articles already exist.
-  CONFIRM the content you find aligns with your understanding of the
   topic.
-  UPDATE article content as needed to ensure accuracy.
-  EXTEND article content (for example, add more detail, create children
   articles) to provide deeper understanding of the topic.

Case Study
----------

A large eCommerce company was rapidly expanding its analytics teams.
Onboarding these new analysts was an ad-hoc process, with junior
analysts shadowing their more experienced colleagues. This was a
time-consuming and inefficient process for both the senior and junior
analysts and the results were inconsistent.

With Alation articles, the company captures the knowledge of its
experienced analysts and presents it in a structured and consistent
format. The articles have links to other articles that are relevant
to analysts, for example, policies for data management and security.
Embedded in each article are links to data sets that are important for
new analysts to understand and start out with. New analysts can also see
links to other analysts in the organization who are willing to serve
as mentors and discuss specific issues. These conversations can be
maintained on Alation so that future analyst classes will have a record
for their reference.

With this approach analysts are climbing the learning curve quicker
resulting in a shorter time to delivering value. With high turnover
among data analysts, it’s crucial that they spend less time to gain
mastery over the data landscape by learning in the same environment as
their data catalog.
