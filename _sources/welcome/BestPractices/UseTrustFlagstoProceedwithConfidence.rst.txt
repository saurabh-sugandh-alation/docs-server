Use Trust Flags and Proceed with Confidence
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Trust Flags* (also known as the red/yellow/green "stoplights") are the
primary way in which trust of data can be communicated to users. Trust
Flags are available at the data source (including file systems and BI
reports), schema, table and column levels, as well as for filters,
joins, and queries.

Users can click the green stoplight to endorse a data object. They
can warn other users about potential issues with data by clicking the
yellow light and adding a required explanation. Similarly, users can
deprecate a data object by clicking the red light and explaining why the
data object is not to be trusted.

In addition to highlighting critical data issues on the catalog pages,
trust flags are now carried forward to SQL writing in Compose using the
Trust Check feature. SQL writers will see highlighted text if data they
are using for their queries is endorsed, warned or deprecated.
Analysts can quickly and easily trust that the data that they are using
is appropriate and proceed with confidence.

Some of the ways we have seen customers use trust flags:

-  Endorse "gold standard" queries
-  Warn about data sets with non-continuous date ranges
-  Deprecate data sets that are being decommissioned

Best Practice #1: Determine who should be able to flag
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For most organizations we recommend a bottom-up approach: enabling the
majority of users to endorse, warn, or deprecate data objects. When
users are properly trained, this maximizes the collective knowledge of
the user community. For example, if a user identifies a problem with
data that they know best they can take action and issue a warning or
deprecation so that the community is immediately informed. 

Some organizations may believe that only stewards have the combination
of knowledge and authority required to assess whether a particular data
object should be trusted. Some organizations may elect a top-down
approach where only stewards are permitted to edit trust flags. Every
element that can be flagged (except for filters, joins, and queries) can
have permissions attached to restrict the ability to edit to the
designated individuals or groups. The downside to this approach is that
if permissions are restricted then the stoplights are not visible, and,
as a result, users will not have as prominent a visual cue for trust
flags. To supplement the knowledge of stewards, all users should be
encouraged to be on the lookout for data quality issues and if they see
something, they should say something by communicating with the
appropriate steward through the Alation conversation feature.

Best Practice #2: Stewards with admin privileges should monitor the trust flags
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having knowledgeable stewards monitor trust flags combines the best of
the top-down and bottom-up approaches of data curation. The knowledge of
the community is captured, but the risk of uncontrolled trust flags is
mitigated. If there is disagreement among users about whether data
should be trusted or not, the stewards with admin capability should
intervene to clarify the discussion and drive to a decision. If
necessary, the steward can delete trust flags that are inaccurate or
obsolete.

Best Practice #3: Provide a rationale when warning or deprecating a data object
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a data element is warned or deprecated the user will be prompted to
complete a required text field. This is where the rationale for the
warning or deprecation should be documented. For example, if there is a
problem with the data pipeline, it should be indicated in the text field
for the warning or deprecation. In addition to clearly stating the
problem, best practice would be to include appropriate contacts, links
to articles, and time frames for resolution or data source
decommissioning (if applicable).

Warnings should be used where data is essentially accurate, but certain
precautions should be taken or conditions accounted for. For example, if
there’s a data set that has accurate data but only over a certain time
frame, that should be noted in a warning. On the other hand,
deprecations should indicate data that is fundamentally flawed and
should not be used, at least for the time being.

Best Practice #4: Display alternative data sources
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often when one data source is deprecated, it is because there is
another, better source that should be used. By using a link to the
preferred data set in the deprecation, Alation can be used to point
users to the data that is trustworthy.

*Endorse - Warn - Deprecate*

Best Practice #5: Consider when to use endorsements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning and deprecating data are clearly to be used when there are
exceptions and data need to be flagged as untrustworthy for one reason
or another. Depending on the current state of your data, stewards may
consider using endorsements in a similar matter. For instance, if a data
source has many instances of *untrustworthy* data, it may be necessary
to proactively endorse data that is good. In this
case *trustworthy* data can be considered the exception that needs to
be called out using the endorsement trust flag. 

Another time to consider using endorsements is where there are two
similar data sets that may be "in competition". In this case
endorsements can prevent potential misunderstandings about which data
set to use. This is a situation that shouldn’t last for long as the
"losing" data set should be deprecated and, ultimately, decommissioned.

Best Practice #6: Encourage users to flag filters, joins, and queries
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All users can flag filters, joins, and queries. Users
have the responsibility to be on the lookout for problems with data and
how it is used in queries and should use the flags to document their
concerns. As an example, if there is a poorly constructed query that is
consuming inordinate DB resources, it should be flagged, with a link to
a "gold standard" model query included in the warning explanation. Like the
data catalog pages, stewards with admin privileges should
monitor and control trust flags so they are not used inappropriately.
