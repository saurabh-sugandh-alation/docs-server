You can view and change Alation catalog user profiles. A user profile has:

- an avatar
- a user description
- additional user information, such as position/title
- published queries

and is visible to other catalog users. Alation automatically enriches a user profile by identifying user areas of expertise.

A user with sufficient permission level can:

- customize Compose settings and default preferences
- set email notification preferences by enabling or disabling notifications
- change the user's Alation password
- view and remove cached database connections
- create refresh tokens to access Alation APIs
- set CSV download options
