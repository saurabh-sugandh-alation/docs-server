Homepage

The homepage is where users land after signing in to Alation. Its purpose is to facilitate the discovery of the catalog content and to simplify navigation. The homepage can also be accessed any time by clicking the logo in the top left corner of the Alation application.

The homepage can include quick links to prioritized and curated content and to various Alation tools, such as Compose, search, or relevant articles.

From Alation version 2023.3.4 and later, homepages are based on user groups, so each user group can have its own custom homepage. For example, a user group representing a business unit or organization can have a dedicated custom homepage. If you’re a member of multiple user groups that each has a custom homepage, you can choose which homepage to view by clicking on the **My Account** icon in the top right corner of Alation.

You can also choose which homepage will be your preferred homepage by clicking on the star next to that homepage. Your preferred homepage is the one you’ll see when you log into Alation or when you click on the logo in the top left corner. If your preferred homepage or the user group that’s assigned to it gets deleted, the Alation Default Homepage will become your preferred homepage.

The homepage can be customized by a Server Admin or Catalog Admin to better suit users’ needs. See :doc:`/admins/CustomizableHomePage/index` for more information.

If you get an error about insufficient permissions when clicking on a link on your homepage, it may be because something with restricted access was added to your homepage. Contact your Alation administrator to resolve the situation.
