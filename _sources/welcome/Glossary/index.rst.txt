Alation Analytics                  A :doc:`database that surfaces catalog usage data <../../installconfig/AlationAnalyticsV2/index>`
                                   to provide a way for
                                   governance officers and analysts
                                   to implement better adoption of

                                   interact with the data.

Alation Catalog                    The component of the Alation
                                   software that serves to catalog
                                   and describe data sources
                                   offering several applications
                                   on top (such as *Agile Approval*
                                   or *Stewardship Dashboard*). This is
                                   often referred to as "the
                                   Catalog". Also see Compose.

Alation Object                     An entity in the Alation catalog
                                   that can have a dedicated catalog
                                   page. Almost everything you see
                                   in Alation is an object, for
                                   example: a *data source* object,
                                   a *table* object, a *query*
                                   object, or an *article* object.

Alation Search                     A set of features that allow
                                   searching and finding objects in
                                   the Catalog.

Alation Role                       When you hear :doc:`Alation roles </welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>`,
                                   it is usually one of the roles a
                                   user can be assigned when they
                                   join Alation: Viewer, Composer, Steward,
                                   Catalog Admin, or Server
                                   Admin. Also see Data
                                   Source Admin.

Article                            An object in the Alation catalog
                                   that can be used for data
                                   documentation. You can create an
                                   article to store some long-form
                                   written content, such as detailed
                                   data policies or analytical
                                   insights. Articles can be added
                                   to Article Groups that
                                   help bind related pieces of
                                   information together.

Article Group                      An object that is a "collection"
                                   of articles based on the same
                                   custom template. Articles :doc:`can be grouped into an article group </steward/ArticleGroups/WorkwithArticleGroups>`
                                   when they are related to one
                                   topic and are complementary to
                                   each other.

Built-in Field                     A field on a catalog
                                   page :doc:`template </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CatalogTemplates>`
                                   that cannot be removed or
                                   modified. This typically has
                                   property values.

Catalog Admin                      A role in Alation granted to
                                   users whose primary task is
                                   curating the catalog and
                                   supervising the curation effort
                                   by other users.

Catalog Page                       A dedicated page for an Alation
                                   object that you see in the
                                   Alation Catalog. Catalog pages
                                   are based on
                                   customizable :doc:`templates </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CatalogTemplates>`
                                   that have built-in and custom
                                   fields. Users enrich their
                                   catalog by providing field
                                   values-information describing
                                   the Alation object.

Catalog Page Template              Template used to "assemble" a
                                   catalog page from built-in and
                                   custom fields. Alation has two
                                   types of catalog page templates:
                                   *object templates* and
                                   *article templates* (or *custom
                                   templates*). :doc:`Article templates <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/BuildCustomTemplatesforArticles>`
                                   can be created by users. Both
                                   types of templates can be
                                   customized by adding custom
                                   fields.

Catalog Set                        Alation object that enables you
                                   to group data objects together
                                   and perform bulk edit operations
                                   on custom fields. Bulk edits are
                                   done on the Catalog Sets page,
                                   rather than on the data object
                                   page.

Column Lineage                     Visual representation (a diagram)

                                   access Compose either using your
                                   web browser or by downloading the
                                   Alation Compose app to your
                                   computer.

Conversations                      Alation enables you to publicly
                                   ask and answer questions through
                                   :doc:`Conversations </welcome/Conversations/index>`,
                                   which live on any data object,
                                   query, result set, or user
                                   profile.

Dynamic Profiling                  When enabling dynamic profiling:

                                   - Profiles will be user specific
                                     and user initiated.
                                   - Profiling will use user's
                                     database credentials.
                                   - Automatic profiling will be
                                     disabled.

Filters                            Alation learns from you every

                                   tables or use a data expression,
                                   Alation will automatically pick
                                   it up and enable you to save it
                                   for quick reuse. On the table
                                   Catalog page, all previously used
                                   JOIN clauses are on the Joins
                                   tab. Data expressions are on the
                                   Filters tab.

Glossary                           An object that is a "collection"

                                   that helps trace the origin of
                                   data in Tables and Columns and
                                   gives visibility into how data in
                                   a source moves and transforms
                                   over time. Input data for Lineage
                                   diagrams comes from QLI, queries
                                   in Compose, and can be added using
                                   the dedicated API.

Metadata Extraction (MDE)          Extraction of metadata from a
                                   data source into the Catalog with
                                   the goal of synchronizing them
                                   and providing Alation users with
                                   a representation of the data
                                   contained in this source.
                                   :doc:`Metadata extraction <../../sources/CatalogSources/MetadataExtraction>`
                                   can be run manually or on an
                                   automatic schedule.

NoSQL Database                     NoSQL databases are software
                                   systems that provide storage and
                                   query capabilities to support
                                   specific data models and access
                                   patterns for building modern
                                   applications using flexible
                                   schemas.

Object Template                    Catalog page
                                   :doc:`template <../../steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CatalogTemplates>`
                                   for Alation objects, such as data
                                   objects and queries. This can be
                                   modified by adding or removing
                                   custom fields. This cannot be created
                                   or removed by Alation users.

Obfuscate Literals                 When enabled, hides all literals
                                   in queries. Only the query owner
                                   will be able to see the full
                                   query.

Object Type                        Property of an Alation object
                                   that describes what kind of
                                   object it is. Each specific
                                   Alation object has a type. For
                                   example, your MySQL data source
                                   is an object of type "data",
                                   or your article "How to use JOINs
                                   in Alation Analytics Database" is
                                   an object of type "article".

Popularity                         An indicator of the intensity of
                                   use of a data object. Popularity
                                   is determined with an algorithm
                                   that accounts for both query
                                   ingestion (the number of data
                                   source accounts that used the
                                   object and the number of times
                                   the object was used) and Compose
                                   usage (the number of Alation
                                   users that used the object in
                                   Compose and the number of times
                                   the object was used).

Profiling/Sampling                 Creation of data samples for the
                                   cataloged data sources. When you
                                   perform data profiling in
                                   Alation, it scans the first
                                   10,000 rows of a table. A data
                                   sample is a random sample of 100
                                   rows out of the 10,000 scanned
                                   rows intended to provide you an
                                   insight to what kind of data is
                                   contained in the profiled table
                                   without the need to run a query.

Query Collaboration                A collaborative workflow in
                                   Compose that lets users develop
                                   queries together. You can
                                   co-create queries leveraging the
                                   expertise of all Authors and the
                                   institutional knowledge. A query Owner
                                   can start the collaboration
                                   workflow by adding Authors to
                                   their queries. All Authors can
                                   take turns editing the query
                                   statement. They can also invite
                                   more Authors to contribute.

Query Execution                    The action and process of running
                                   a query using Alation. You may
                                   also encounter the term "query
                                   run" which is equivalent to query execution.

Query Log Ingestion (QLI)          The processing of the database
                                   query logs in order or to
                                   calculate Popularity, Lineage,
                                   Top Users, and to supply
                                   filter and JOIN information to
                                   the catalog.

Query Result Table                 The results of the query
                                   execution. You can save the
                                   results of a query as the Result
                                   Table object in the Alation
                                   catalog.

Server Admin                       A role in Alation that has access to
                                   the full scope of functionality
                                   in the Catalog and Compose,
                                   including the application
                                   settings.

Standard User                      A role in Alation that has access to
                                   Compose and the main features of
                                   the Catalog, with the exception
                                   of admin settings and catalog
                                   customization tools (such as
                                   templates and custom fields).

Top Users                          On Schema and Table catalog
                                   pages, Alation automatically
                                   lists Top Users
                                   through calculating expert
                                   status. Alation calculates
                                   expertise on a data object based
                                   on several factors: number of
                                   the user’s queries that mention
                                   the data object, number of times
                                   the user added comments, titles,
                                   or descriptions to the data
                                   object page, nomination by other
                                   users.

Tree Table                         A table-like element of the
                                   catalog interface with expandable
                                   rows revealing nested elements.
                                   Mostly used to represent complex
                                   data types, such as records,
                                   arrays, or structs.

Virtual Data Source                A type of source object in
                                   Alation that can be used to
                                   catalog data storage that is
                                   either unsupported by Alation
                                   with a built-in or custom driver
                                   or for some reason cannot be
                                   accessed from Alation using the
                                   URI (could be for security
                                   reasons). There is no automated
                                   MDE, Profiling and Sampling, or
                                   QLI for Virtual Sources, and the
                                   metadata should be uploaded using
                                   the API. One example of the use
                                   of a Virtual Data Source is to
                                   catalog Avro schemas from data
                                   streaming platforms. Virtual
                                   Sources can be used for querying
                                   in Compose if the database
                                   supports SQL dialects and if you
                                   choose to add the Compose
                                   connection information.
