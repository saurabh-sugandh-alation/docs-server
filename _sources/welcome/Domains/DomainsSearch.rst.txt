=================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from release 2021.1*

.. note::

      Domains Search is part of Alation Full-Page search. This page highlights the features belonging to Domains Search. Refer to :doc:`Full-Page Search <../../welcome/CatalogBasics/FullPageSearch>` for information about Full-Page Search features.

Searching within a Domain can help focus the search and accelerate the discovery of relevant data.

The search box is located on the top and center of the catalog page. Searches can be performed specifically in a single Domain or Subdomain or across all Domains by selecting an option from the drop list. The All Domains search will search among all objects in the Catalog including objects that do not belong to any Domain.

Alation users can drill down to make these searches even more granular or drill up to make them broader. The search results page has several filter options to filter the search results. The **More Types** list has the Domains Object Type, which allows the user to search all the existing Domains. The following standard filters are available for most of the object types and the remaining filters vary based on the searched object type:


    -  Object Type
    -  Started/Watched/Visited
    -  Source
    -  Flags
    -  Tagged With

Browse a Domain
-------------------

*Applies from 2021.2*

Users can browse the objects added to a Domain directly on the Catalog page or on the Domains page. The Browse this Domain section displays all the Objects added to the Domain; users can browse the objects from the objects list using the filters. Users can also search in all the available Domains using the :doc:`Full Page Search <../../welcome/CatalogBasics/FullPageSearch>`.
