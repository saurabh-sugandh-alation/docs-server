Interacting with Conversations
==============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Every catalog user has the opportunity to contribute to Conversations that have been :doc:`posted in Alation </welcome/Conversations/PostingANewConversation>`. Users can easily access a posted Conversation if it :doc:`appears in their Inbox </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`, and they also have the opportunity to :doc:`discover any Conversation </welcome/Conversations/FindingConversations>` by opening the Conversations slideout or conducting a search.

Once you find a Conversation, you can participate in it by:

-  Replying to it.

-  Interacting with other users’ comments.

-  Making changes to the Conversation’s connections.

-  Resolving or reopening the Conversation.

-  Inviting other users to join the discussion.

If you’re the Conversation’s author, you can also:

-  Edit the body text of the Conversation.

-  Delete the entire Conversation.

You can interact with a Conversation anywhere you find it in the catalog. All of a Conversation’s interactive features are available inside your Inbox or a Conversations slideout, but you can also open the Conversation in full-page view to see it independent of other catalog pages.

.. _Full-Page View:

Full-Page View
--------------

When you open a Conversation in full-page view, Alation displays it by itself in the catalog interface. Full-page view acts like a Conversation’s catalog page and provides easy access to all of its :ref:`components <Conversation Components>` and features.

Conversations that you access from the :ref:`Conversations panel <Conversations Search Conversations Panel>` or the :ref:`search page <Search Feature>` always open in full-page view. You can also open a Conversation in full-page view from the Conversations slideout using the steps below.

1. Click the slideout tab to open the Conversations slideout and view the Conversations in its **Started Here** and **Mentioning This** areas. (For screenshots and more details about the Conversations slideout, see the :ref:`Conversations slideout <The Conversations Slideout>` section of Finding Conversations.)

2. Click the Conversation you’d like to see in full-page view. The Conversation will expand so that you can see all of its components.

3. Click the three dots ( **...** ) in the Conversation’s upper-right corner.

4. From the dropdown menu that opens, select **Full Page View**.

.. note::

   Conversations can’t be opened in full-page view from inside your Inbox. They open inside your Inbox’s reading pane, and you can access all of their features from there.

.. _Participant Capabilities:

Participant Capabilities
------------------------

Any catalog user can interact with a catalog Conversation as a participant, including the Conversation’s author. The Conversations feature allows participants to build on a Conversation in a variety of ways.

You can participate in a Conversation if you’ve opened it inside :doc:`the Inbox </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`, :ref:`the Conversations slideout <The Conversations Slideout>`, or :ref:`full-page view <Full-Page View>`. In order to participate in a Conversation inside the Inbox or a Conversations slideout, you must click its list entry to see it in an expanded view.

Once you’ve opened a Conversation inside one of these areas, you can use the directions in the sections below to interact with it.

.. _Liking a Comment:

Liking a Comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can like another user’s comment to indicate that you found it helpful.

To like a comment, click the heart icon below its time stamp.

.. note::

   You can’t like your own comments, and other users can’t see that you’ve liked a comment.

You can make changes to comments that you posted by editing or deleting them.

To make changes to one of your comments, click the three dots ( **...** ) below its time stamp. Select **Edit Comment** or **Delete Comment** from the dropdown menu that opens.

If you select **Delete Comment**, your comment will be deleted immediately.

   Server Admins can delete any Conversation’s comment, even if they didn’t post it and have never participated in the Conversation.

.. _Changing Connections:

Changing Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants can adjust a Conversation’s connections by making changes to its **Referring to** and **Assigned to** fields.

.. note::

   If you’re viewing a Conversation inside a Conversations slideout, the **Referring to** field will not be visible. To change the Conversation’s reference, open it in full-page view using the directions in the :ref:`Full-Page View section <Full-Page View>`, then follow the instructions in this section.

If the Conversation doesn’t have an assignee or reference, you can add one using the directions in the :ref:`Assigned to <Adding Connections Assigned to>` and :ref:`Referring to sections <Adding Connections Referring to>` of Posting a New Conversation.

If the Conversation has an assignee or reference that you’d like to change, hover over its link in the **Assigned to** or **Referring to** field. Click the **X** that appears. Then, follow the instructions in Posting a New Conversation to :ref:`add a new reference <Adding Connections Referring to>` or :ref:`assignee <Adding Connections Assigned to>`.

.. _Resolving and Reopening a Conversation:

Resolving and Reopening a Conversation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a Conversation participant, you can indicate a Conversation’s status with the **Mark Resolved** button. The **Mark Resolved** button shows future users whether a Conversation has been concluded or is still an active discussion.

To demonstrate that a Conversation is no longer active, click the **Mark Resolved** button to the left of the **Assigned to** field. The button will change to display **Resolved!**. The **Reply** button will also be replaced by a **Reopen to Reply** button to discourage future users from adding to a closed Conversation.

If you want to add to a resolved Conversation, you can reopen it in two different ways.

-  Click the **Resolved!** button to the left of the **Assigned to** field. Select **Reopen** from the dropdown dialog that opens. Once the Conversation has been reopened, you can post a new comment by clicking the **Reply** button.

-  Click the **Reopen to Reply** button in the Conversation’s lower-left corner. The Conversation will reopen and a reply dialog will appear so that you can post a new comment.

.. note::

   Marking a Conversation as resolved doesn’t change its visibility in the catalog or your Inbox. You can :ref:`delete a Conversation that you started <Deleting a Conversation>` to make it less visible in the catalog. If you want to make a Conversation less visible inside your Inbox, :ref:`archive <Archiving Conversations>` it.

.. _Inviting Other Catalog Users:

Inviting Other Catalog Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants can bring a Conversation to other users’ attention by inviting them to participate in it. When you invite a user to a Conversation, Alation sends them a notification that they can use to open the Conversation and interact with it.

To invite one or more users to a Conversation, follow the steps below.

1. Click the three dots ( **...** ) in the Conversation’s upper-right corner.

2. Select **Invite to Conversation** from the dropdown menu that appears. A dialog containing **Recipients** and **Note** fields will open.

3. Click in the **Recipients** field. A list of catalog users will open below it. You can use the field to choose recipients in two ways:

   -  Select a recipient from the list of catalog users. You can scroll through the list to find a user or filter the list by entering text in the **Recipients** field. When you see the user you’d like to invite in the list of catalog users, select their name.

   -  Invite users through email by typing their email address in the **Recipients** field. After you finish typing, press **Enter**. The email address will be added to the list of recipients in the field.

4. If you want to edit the invitation message, click in the **Note** field and make changes.

5. Click **Send**. Alation will deliver notifications about the Conversation to the recipients you selected.

   .. note::

      Recipients selected from the list of catalog users will receive an invitation to the Conversation in their Alation Inbox. If you send an invitation to an email address, Alation will send the email address a link to the Conversation. The recipient can open the Conversation by following the link and signing into Alation.

.. _Author Capabilities:

Author Capabilities
-------------------

Alation allows a Conversation’s author to participate in it just like other catalog users. In addition, authors are given the ability to edit the Conversation’s body text or delete the entire Conversation.

You can interact with a Conversation as an author if you’ve opened it inside :doc:`the Inbox </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`, :ref:`the Conversations slideout <The Conversations Slideout>`, or :ref:`full-page view <Full-Page View>`. If you’re inside the slideout or Inbox, click the Conversation to expand it. Then follow the directions below to edit or delete the Conversation.

.. _Editing a Conversation:

Editing a Conversation

A Conversation’s author can edit its initial post at any time. Making changes to a Conversation’s initial post allows the author to reshape the resulting discussion.

To edit the Conversation’s initial post:

1. Click the three dots ( **...** ) in the Conversation’s upper-right corner.

2. Select **Edit Post** from the dropdown menu that opens. The Conversation’s initial post will open in an editing window.

.. _Deleting a Conversation:

Deleting a Conversation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authors can delete their Conversations to prevent other users from adding more responses and make the Conversation less visible in the catalog.

If a Conversation appears inside a Conversations slideout, it will be removed when you delete it. The deleted Conversation will still be visible in :ref:`the Conversations panel <Conversations Search Conversations Panel>`, :ref:`search page <Search Feature>`, and users’ :doc:`Inboxes </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`, but it will include a **This Conversation has been deleted** banner above its subject line. Catalog users will be able to view the Conversation, but can’t add new comments or make changes.

.. note::

   If you want to indicate that a discussion is finished but leave it inside the Conversations slideout, :ref:`mark it as resolved <Resolving and Reopening a Conversation>`. To make a Conversation less visible inside your Inbox, :ref:`archive <Archiving Conversations>` it.

To delete a Conversation:

1. Click the three dots ( **...** ) in the Conversation’s upper-right corner.

2. Select **Delete Conversation** from the dropdown menu that opens. The Conversation, including all of its replies, will be deleted.

Conversation authors can restore their deleted Conversations at any time from :ref:`full-page view <Full-Page View>` or their :doc:`Inbox </welcome/Conversations/UsingYourInbox>`. To restore a Conversation, click the **Restore** button to the right of the **This Conversation has been deleted** banner.

.. note::

   Users with a Server Admin role can delete or restore any Conversation in Alation, even if they are not its author.
