Change Visibility of Unpublished Queries
========================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2023.1*

Alation Cloud Service customers can submit a support ticket to request changes to the visibility of unpublished queries. Server Admins for on-premise customers can use the instructions below. This action will require the search index to be rebuilt, which can take hours for larger instances.

For details on the effects of changing the visibility of unpublished queries, see :ref:`Unpublished Query Access`.

To change the visibility of unpublished queries as a Server Admin for on-premise instances of Alation:

.. include:: /shared/AccessingAlationShell.rst

#. You can change the visibility of unpublished queries for all data sources or specific data sources. Use one of the following commands:

   -  To **turn on** the visibility of unpublished queries for **all** data sources, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         alation_conf alation.catalog.unpublished_query_visibility_level -s visible

   -  To **turn off** the visibility of unpublished queries for **all** data sources, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         alation_conf alation.catalog.unpublished_query_visibility_level -s not_visible

   -  To turn on visibility of unpublished queries for **specific** data sources, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         alation_conf alation.catalog.unpublished_query_visibility_level -s per_ds

      Then run the following command, entering into the single quotes the IDs of the data sources for which you want unpublished queries to be **visible**:

      .. code-block:: bash

         alation_conf unpublished_query_visible_ds_ids_csv -s '1,5'

      Unpublished queries will be visible for the data sources you list in the single quotes. Unpublished queries will *not* be visible for data sources that arenâ€™t listed.

#. Run the following command to rebuild the search index:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alation_action rebuild_es_index

   .. note::

   	This command kicks off the rebuild_index task. How long it takes depends on Rosemeta size and may take hours on large instances. You can monitor the task status in **Admin Settings** > **Monitor** > **Active Tasks**.

#. Exit the Alation shell:

   .. code-block:: bash

      exit
