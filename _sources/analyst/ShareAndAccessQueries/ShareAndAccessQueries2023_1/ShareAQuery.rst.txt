Share a Query
=============

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2023.1*

If you have view or run access to a query, you can share the query with colleagues. Alation will automatically send them an email with a link to the query. This doesn’t change the query’s access settings. The person you share the query with will be subject to their own access level.

To give others access, you must have edit or owner access to the query. See :doc:`/analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2023_1/ChangeAccessToAQuery`.

To share a link to a query as a user with view or run access:

#. Do one of the following:

   -  Open the query in Compose.

   -  Open the query's catalog page and click the three dots **(...)** in the top right corner.

#. Click **Share**.

#. In the **Share** dialog, enter an Alation user’s name or email address. A list of possible users will start to form as you type. Select the desired user from the list.

#. Enter a message in the provided box. The message will be included in the email Alation sends.

#. If you want, click **Copy Link**. A link to the query will be copied to your clipboard. You can share it however you like.

#. Click **Send**. Alation will automatically send the selected users an email with a link to the query.
