*Applies from 2023.1*

Starting in 2023.1, permission to access queries can be controlled in a granular way. You can control access to each query separately by granting permission to view, run, or edit the query to individual users or groups. Prior to this feature, anyone could find and view any query as long as they had access to the underlying data source. Queries could only be hidden by configuring Alation to hide unpublished queries.

Now with granular query permissions, it’s possible to keep sensitive queries fully private and ensure only approved parties get the level of access they need. There’s no need to leave queries unpublished in order to keep them hidden.

The topics in this section will help you understand and implement granular query permissions in 2023.1 and later:
