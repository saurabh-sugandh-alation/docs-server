Adding Query Authors in the Catalog
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. include:: /shared/GranularQueryPermissionNote.rst

When a query has multiple authors, the catalog page of
this query object will include a built-in field authors. This
field has the names of users who are currently collaborating on
this query as Authors:

If you are one of the authors, you can add and remove authors from the
query directly in the catalog, without opening this query in Compose.Â 

To add/remove authors,

1. On the catalog page of the query, hover over the **Authors** field. This will reveal the **Edit** link:

        :width: 200px

2. Click **Edit** to open the **Query Access** dialog:

3. Add and remove query authors. See :doc:`Granting Access to Your Queries in Compose </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/GrantAccesstoQueriesinCompose>` for details on the **Query Access** dialog.
4. When done, click **Submit**. The **Authors** field will reflect the changes you have made.
