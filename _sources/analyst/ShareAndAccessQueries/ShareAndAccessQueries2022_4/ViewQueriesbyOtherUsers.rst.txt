Your ability to find and view a query in Alation depends on these
conditions:

-  Your access to the Data Source used in the query
-  Your role in Alation

.. note::

    Users in Alation can view both published and unpublished queries. The
    access to a query is not controlled by the publishing status of a
    query.

When a user is added as Author to a query on a Private data source, or when someone shares a query on a data source that the user does not have access to, they will not be able to view his query and will get a permissions error when trying to open it. To view such a query, request access to the data source from your Alation admins.

Only the query Owner and Authors can edit the statement of the query. If you found or were shared a query you want to collaborate on, you can :doc:`request access </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/RequestAccesstoQueries>` from the current query collaborators.
