Granting Access and Sharing Queries in the Catalog
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. include:: /shared/GranularQueryPermissionNote.rst

In the Catalog, you can grant edit access to a query or share it with
colleagues to make them aware of the existence of this query. To share
in the catalog, you need to be the query owner, author, or have
the **Server Admin** role.

Alternatively, you can share queries using Compose: :doc:`Sharing Queries in Compose </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/ShareQueriesinCompose>`. Any user who can open
the query in Compose, can share it, with the reservation that viewers
can share for viewing only.

To share a query from the Catalog,

1. Open your query in the Catalog.
2. On the upper right of the query page, click **Share**. This will bring up the **Share** dialog. How you can share, depends on your access level to the query. If you are a **Server Admin** who is not an author, you can only share for viewing, and will not be able to change the access. If you are owner or author, you can share and add/remove authors simultaneously with sharing.

3. In the **Share with a Colleague** field, add users to share the query with:

        :width: 300px

4. To the right of the field, select access permissions: **Viewer** or **Author**. This permission will be assigned to all the users you have selected in the **Share with a Colleague** field. The author permission will add the user as a collaborator to this query and allow them to edit the query statement, grant access to other users, and perform :doc:`other actions </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/index>` on the query:

5. Optionally, add a note to the **Note** field if you want to add a message to the email.
6. To simultaneously share the results of this query with the selected users, select the checkbox **Grant access** for the above users to all of your results for this query.

7. If you need the link to the query you are sharing, copy it to your clipboard by clicking **Copy Link** under **Copy Share Link**.

8. If you want to see who currently collaborates of this query, click **Who Can Access** on the top right of the **Sharing** dialog:

9. This will open the **Query Access** dialog. It is the same dialog you see in Compose when giving access to queries: :doc:`Granting Access to Queries in Compose </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/GrantAccesstoQueriesinCompose>`.

10. If you have added or removed authors, click **Submit** to go back to the **Share** dialog. Or click **Cancel** to close the **Access** dialog and go back to **Share**.
11. To finish sharing, click **Send** on the lower right of the dialog.
