Requesting Access to Queries
=====================================================================

   Query collaboration relies on Alation being able to send email
   notifications to users. If email notifications from Alation go to
   your spam folder, unmark emails from Alation as spam. You can
   also contact your network admin and request to whitelist the Alation
   IP. 

In Alation, a user can find and view both published and unpublished
queries if:

-  This user is owner of these queries.
-  A user is query author and has access to the data source used in the queries.
-  These are queries against a public data source.
-  These are queries against a private data source but the user has
   access to this data source. Users with the **Server Admin** role can view queries against all Private data sources.
-  These queries are shared with the user, and this user has access to the data source used in the queries. 

.. note::

     If a query uses a Private data source, it can only be
     opened by users who have access to this data source.

     When a user is added as Author to a query on a Private data source
     that they do not have access to, or when someone shares a query on a
     private data source that the user cannot access, they will NOT be
     able to view this query and get a permissions error.

     To view such a query, request access to the data source from your
     Alation admins.

Only the query owner and authors can edit the statement of the query. If
you found or were shared a query you want to collaborate on as an
author, you can request access from the current query collaborators.

To request access,

1. Open the query in Compose.
2. On the info-banner on top of the query statement, click **Request Access**. This sends a request email to all current query collaborators:

  One of the collaborators will invite you to collaborate on this query
  when they receive the email. You will receive an email notification
  informing you that you now can edit the query.
