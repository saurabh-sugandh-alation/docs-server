Granting Access to Queries in Compose
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. include:: /shared/GranularQueryPermissionNote.rst

Query owner and authors can invite people to collaborate on a
query by granting edit access to this query to others. There are several
alternative ways to add Authors to a query. This article explains how to
add authors in Compose. You can also do it :doc:`in the Catalog </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/GrantAccessandSharingQueriesintheCatalog>`.

It is important that you have whitelisted the Alation application in
your network. Compose will send out email notifications to Authors and
Viewers when they are invited and when queries are shared with users.

Giving Query Access
-------------------

1. Open your query in Compose.

   .. note::

      **Your** means you are the query owner, author, or a server admin.

2. On the toolbar, on the right, click **More...** and in the menu, click **Query Access**. This will open the **Query Access** dialog:

3. To designate authors, in the **Query Access** dialog, click the **Authors** section:

   .. image:: /_static/Access01.png

4. This opens the list of existing authors and reveals the **Invite** button. Click **Invite** and select a user. This user will be added as an author:

   .. note::

       The current query owner or a Server Admin can transfer ownership to a different user: :doc:`Transferring Ownership </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/index>`.

       If you select the Owner access for a user, after submitting the change, the ownership will be transferred from the current query Owner to this new user. The current owner’s access will be switched to *Author*.

5. In the **Query Access** dialog, you can also view which users have access to your results of this query: click **Your Results Are Shared With** panel to open the list of users with access to some or all of your results for this query:

   .. image:: /_static/Results2.png

   .. note::

      You can only share your results, that is, the result tables that
      were created when you ran this query in Alation. Results created by other users may have different access permissions.

6. If you want to stop sharing your results with specific users, remove these users from the shared results list by clicking the X button next to the user’s name.

7. In the dialog, click **Submit**. The newly designated authors will receive email notifications with a link to the query.

Giving Access While Sharing
---------------------------

You can also give access to a query when you are sharing it with users.

See :doc:`Sharing Queries in Compose </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/ShareQueriesinCompose>`.

Changing Access Permissions
---------------------------

As a query owner, author or an intervening server admin, you can change query access in the following ways:

-  Add new Authors: `Giving Query Access`_.
-  Remove a user from authors. This action will revoke the edit access from a user.
-  Transfer ownership to a user. This can be done by owner and server admin.

Removing a User From Authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a user from Authors of a query:

1. Open your query in Compose.
2. On the toolbar, on the right, click **More...** and in the menu, click **Query Access**. This will bring up the **Query Access** dialog for this query.
3. In the **Query Access** dialog, click the **Authors** section. This opens the list of existing authors.
4. For the user you are revoking access from, select **Remove** in the **Access** list. This will label the user with the **Remove** action. It will be applied after you submit the change:

5. Click **Submit**. The user from whom you have revoked the edit access can now only view this query.

Transferring Ownership
----------------------

Transferring query ownership means the previous owner no longer will
have the owner-level access to the query. This can only be done by the
current owner or by a user with the **Server Admin** role.

To transfer ownership,

1. Open your query in Compose.
2. On the toolbar, on the right, click **More...** and in the menu, click **Query Access**. This will bring up the **Query Access** dialog for this query.
3. In the **Query Access** dialog, click the **Authors** section. This opens the list of existing authors.
4. Find the user to transfer ownership to or find and add a new user by clicking **Invite**.
5. For this user, in the permissions dropdown, select **Owner**. Note that when you transfer ownership from yourself, you will remain as author of this query:

6. Click **Save**. You have designated a new owner of this query.

.. note::

     You can remove yourself from authors of a query by selecting
     the **Remove** action for yourself. Note that if you remove
     yourself from authors, your edit access will be revoked, and you will
     remain as query viewer.
