Sharing Queries in Compose
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. include:: /shared/GranularQueryPermissionNote.rst

You can share a query with users to make them aware that the query
exists in the catalog or you can share and invite them to collaborate at
the same time. Sharing means sending the link to the query using email:
the other user will receive an email and will be able to access the
query following the included link.

To share,

1. Open your query in Compose.
2. On the toolbar, on the right, click **Share** to open the sharing dialog:

3. In the **Share with a Colleague** field, add users to share the query with:

        :width: 300px

4. To the right of the field, select access permissions: **Viewer** or **Author**. This permission will be assigned to all the users you have selected in the **Share with a Colleague** field. The author permission will add the user as a collaborator to this query and allow them to edit the query statement, grant access to other users, and perform :doc:`other actions </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/index>` on the query:

5. Optionally, add a note to the **Note** field if you want to add a message to the email.
6. To simultaneously share the results of this query with the selected users, select the checkbox **Grant access** for the above users to all of your results for this query.
7. If you need the link to the query you are sharing, you can copy it to your clipboard. To copy the link, click **Copy Link** under **Copy Share Link**.
8. If necessary, from the **Share** dialog, you can see who currently has access to this query. To view current authors and viewers, click the **Who Can Access?** link on the top right. This will bring up the **Access** dialog: :doc:`Granting Access to Queries in Compose </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2022_4/GrantAccesstoQueriesinCompose>`. If you are an Author of the query you are sharing, you can add or remove collaborators, too.
9. To finish sharing, click **Send** on the bottom right. The users you have included in the sharing list will receive email notifications with a link to the query.
