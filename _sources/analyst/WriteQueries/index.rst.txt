Compose is the Alation query tool. You can access Compose either through
your web browser or through downloading the Alation Compose app to your
computer. Regardless of where you access Compose, the backend is the same and so
all of your data is the same. 

Like Catalog, Compose :doc:`connects </analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/index>`
to most relational data sources. This
means you can query Hive, Amazon Redshift, Oracle, and more, all from the same
query tool. Alation is an interface for querying the data source
directly, so language specifications and error messages all come
directly from the data source.

Because Alation is a web-based tool, your workspace is accessible from
any machine, any operating system, at any time. 

You have to be connected to the Internet to send the query to
execution, but you don't need to be connected to the internet while your
query is running. All queries get executed on the secure server in
your company’s firewall. 
You can start a query, exit the browser, shut down the computer,
even spill coffee on the hard drive. No matter what happens, the next
time you connect to Alation, from any machine, your query results will be
waiting for you.

Publishing a query significantly boosts its visibility. If you think your query may be useful to your colleagues at some point, make sure to :doc:`publish it </analyst/WriteQueries/DifferencesbetweenPublishingandSaving>` to make it easier for them to find.

In versions 2022.4 and earlier, anyone can find any query on data sources they have access to (and run any query if the Viewer role is not enforced). In versions 2023.1 and later, :doc:`granular query permissions </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2023_1/index>` give you control over who has access to view, run, and edit individual queries.
