Writing Queries Faster and Embedding Code Snippets
=====================================================================

Most analysts have pieces of code they use over and over. You can use
our embed functionality to easily embed the code you reuse the
most in your queries in a few keystrokes. You can embed code in
two different ways: 

-  Embed and edit snippets of code you use frequently
-  Create standard un-editable pieces of code that can be used across
   teams

Embedding editable snippets of code
-----------------------------------

Many analysts use the same joins or clauses frequently. To save
yourself time, and not rewrite these snippets of code over and over, we
allow you to embed existing queries into new queries in Compose using
the embed functionality of hotkeys. 

Setting up your snippets
------------------------

1. Create a query, like any other query in Alation. 
#. Title the query #[name of snippet]. The "#" lets us know it is a snippet and intended to be expanded. 
#. Save the query with your snippet in it and describe it. 

Using your snippets
-------------------

1. Click the embed button or use the **Embed** hotkeys (**Help** > **Learn Hot Keys**)
-  Type the name of your snippet, select it and press **Shift + Enter**. This will populate the code saved in the macro.
