Compose Toolbars
==================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Compose has several toolbars to help you navigate the program. The top and middle toolbars assist you with opening and viewing
queries, the bottom toolbar assists with writing and editing, and the Results toolbar shows you the **Results**, **Preview**, **History**,
and **Description** of your query.

These toolbars have changed over time. References to earlier and later versions are mentioned throughout. View annotations at
the bottom for `2021.4 and earlier`_ versions.

Top-Level Toolbars

There are three toolbars at the top of the screen. The annotations in this section refer to versions 2022.1 and later.
