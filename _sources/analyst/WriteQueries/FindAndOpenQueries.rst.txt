Find and Open Queries 
======================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

There are various ways for you to find and open queries in Alation. The broad range of search options help you 
find any query you have :doc:`access to </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2023_1/index>` that were created in Compose and imported into the Alation data catalog.

Search from the Left Sidebar 
-----------------------------

From the Alation catalog, located in the left-hand navigation sidebar is the **Queries** panel. Within the panel are 
options for you to scroll through all accessible queries in Alation. The sidebar is collapsed by default unless 
you’ve :doc:`configured the sidebar behavior </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/ControlLeft-HandNavigationBarBehavior>` to expand during initial page load. 

When you open the **Queries** panel: 

    * Published queries show by default. 
    
    * You have the option to select and deselect **Favorited** or **Published** to limit your search.
    
    * Deselecting both buttons displays all queries. 

Begin your search inside the panel. 

1. Type any keyword from the title of your query using natural language in the **Search Queries** field. 
   
2. Select the query in the results, which will bring up the catalog page on the right.

3. To edit the query, click the **Compose** button on the far upper right of the catalog page to open it. 


Search from the Queries Tab
----------------------------

You can search for and open queries from the **Queries** tab within the catalog page of a data source’s schema, 
table, or column. The results represent only the current data object. 

The tab displays according to the data object you choose: 

    * In schemas, the **Queries** tab rests next to **Overview** with a number indicating how many queries are using that schema. 
   
    * In tables and columns, the **Queries** tabs show only the queries that include that table or column.

Search Published Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find any published query on data sources you have access to.


There are a few things to keep in mind when you click the **Queries** tab: 

    * The default list displays published queries. 
   
    * The left column displays the query title and description with the query code. 
   
    * The middle column displays details such as the owner and last updated. 
   
    * The right column displays the Compose icon to open the query. 
   

The following steps guide you through finding a published query: 

1. Navigate to the catalog page of any data object that is located within a query. 
   For example, if the query SELECTs the ``id`` column from the ``accounts`` table of the ``customers`` schema, 
   you can navigate to the catalog page for any of those three data objects (``id``, ``accounts``, or ``customers``).
    
2. Click the **Queries** tab. 
        
    * You can narrow the list using natural language in the **filter queries** field. 
        
    * All published queries related to the catalog page you’re on are listed.

3. Mouse over the query you would like to open and click the Compose icon to the far right. 
    
    * Depending on your :doc:`access level</analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2023_1/UnderstandQueryAccess>`,
      buttons to clone, delete, star, and set trust check flags also display in the right column when you mouse over the query. 


Search Ingested Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find queries that were brought into Alation through :doc:`Query Log Ingestion </sources/CatalogSources/QueryLogIngestion>`. 
The ingested queries feature helps you find all related queries in one location. 


There are a few things to keep in mind when you click the Queries tab: 

    * The default list displays published queries. 
    
    * The left column displays the Statement Template icon and the query code. 
    
    * The middle column displays details such as mentions. 
    
    * The right column displays the Compose icon to open the query. 


The following steps guide you through finding an ingested query: 

1. Navigate to the catalog page of any data object that is located within a query. 
   For example, if the query SELECTs the ``id`` column from the ``accounts`` table of the ``customers`` schema, 
   you can navigate to the catalog page for any of those three data objects (``id``, ``accounts``, or ``customers``). 

2. Click the **Queries** tab.

3. Click **History** on the left. 
    
    * You can narrow the list using natural language in the **filter queries** field. 
    
    * All ingested queries related to the catalog page you’re on will be listed.

4. Mouse over the query you would like to open and click the Compose icon to the far right. 

Search from Compose 
---------------------

The Compose menu helps you find and open queries you have access to. The menu option brings up a dialog to 
select folders, search, and filter queries you own, that were shared with you, or that you’ve saved.

1. Click **Compose** in the top toolbar’s upper-left to open the main menu. 

2. Click **Open Query** in the dropdown.

    * **Scheduled**. Lists queries with a schedule.
    
    * **Published**. Lists published queries.
    
    * **Shared with Me**. Lists queries shared with you by other users.

4. You can also find your query by using the filter and sort options in the center.

    * **Open**. Opens the query in Compose.
    
    * **Clone**. Clones the query statement as a new query.
    
    * **Add Group**. Selects a query group and puts the query into that group.
    
    * **Discard**. Deletes the query.
