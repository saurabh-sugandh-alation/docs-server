Understanding Query Warnings
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation allows experts and admins to create and manage custom warnings
for query writers.  

These warnings are displayed when a query writer tries to execute a
query without an important filter or with a wrong JOIN clause. The query
writer can decide to either introduce the suggested corrections or
dismiss the warning and proceed with running their query.
