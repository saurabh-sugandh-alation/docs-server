Publish a Query
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Publishing a query significantly boosts its visibility. If you think
your query may be useful to your colleagues at some point, make sure to
publish it to make it easier for them to find.

1. Open the query in Compose.
2. Click the **Publish** button.
3. Enter a **Title** and **Description** to help your colleagues find and understand your query.
4. Click **Ok**.

If you make changes to a previously published query, your colleagues
will not see the updates unless you click **Publish** again.


Changes to Query Publishing in V R5 (5.9.x)
-------------------------------------------

The state of the query, published or unpublished, affects how it is
displayed to users in the catalog. If you search for queries in
left-hand navigation,:

Authors and Collaborators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the query author or collaborator, you will find and see:

-  All your unpublished queries in their latest state.

You will always see your latest query body, both in Compose and Catalog:

-  All your published queries, which have no unpublished edits, in their latest state.
-  All your Published queries, which are edited but not
   republished in their latest state. In the catalog there is
   currently no way to differentiate between the published part of the
   query and the unpublished edits.

Viewers
~~~~~~~

As the viewer, non-author, you will find and see:

- Unpublished queries and their latest state.
- Published queries, which have no unpublished edits and the query as it currently is.
- Published queries, which have some unpublished edits and only their published part in the catalog with the unpublished changes not visible.
