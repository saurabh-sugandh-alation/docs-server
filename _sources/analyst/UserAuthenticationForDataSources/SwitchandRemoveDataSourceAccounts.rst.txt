To switch data source accounts:

Some people may have multiple accounts for connecting to the same data
source—for example, one with read-only permissions and one also
capable of writing and editing. This is especially common for Hive
users. 

You can switch between previously used data source accounts or add a
new one directly in Compose:

To remove data source accounts: 

#. Exit Compose.
#. Go to **Settings** then **My Account**.
#. Click the **DB Connections** tab. You can remove connections from there.
