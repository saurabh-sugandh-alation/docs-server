Working with Data Source Connections
====================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2022.1*

When using Compose, Dynamic Profiling, Excel Live Reports, query forms, and scheduled queries, you need to connect to data sources to get your data. You may need to work with more than one connection URI when connecting to a data source. For example, you may need to use different URIs for connecting with different databases, schemas, or roles. In Alation, you can add, edit, copy, and delete connection URIs. You can switch between different connections at any time.

.. important::

   Alation can't create or manage user accounts of a data source. You must independently create your account and credentials with the data source first. Then you can connect to it from Alation.

You may also have more than one set of user credentials (username and password) for a given connection URI. For example, you may have one user credential with read-only permissions and another with edit permissions. Whether you can work with multiple sets of credentials depends on how your administrator has configured Alation:

* **Persistent credentials.** Alation stores your credentials so you can reuse them. You can add, edit, and delete saved user credentials and switch between them at any time.
* **Transient credentials.** Alation doesn’t store credentials at all. You can only work with one set of user credentials at a time. You have to re-enter credentials when they expire (default one hour) and anytime the page refreshes. See `Transient User Credentials`_ for more information.
* **Single sign-on (SSO).** Alation doesn’t store your credentials. You authenticate through a third-party identity provider instead of through Alation. You can only work with one set of user credentials at a time.

.. note::

	Administrators or others wanting more details about these authentication options can see :doc:`User Authentication for Data Sources <../../analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/index>`.

Connection Settings Dialog
--------------------------

You can work with data source connections using the Connection Settings dialog. To authenticate with a data source in Compose or in a query form, you must select both a *connection* (URI) and a *user* (with associated credentials) in the Connection Settings dialog. This combination of connection and user is considered the *active connection*. Once you’ve connected, you don’t have to connect again until your credentials expire.

In 2022.1 and newer, the Connection Settings dialog is available for:

-  Compose
-  Excel Live reports
-  Query forms

In 2022.2 and newer, the Connection Settings dialog is also available for:

-  Dynamic Profiling
-  Scheduled queries

Compose
~~~~~~~

In Compose, you can access the Connection Settings dialog from the toolbar:

Viewing the Active Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At any point you can view the details of the active connection by hovering over the information icon next to the Connection Settings button.

Below you’ll find instructions for working with *connections* and *user credentials* in the Connection Settings dialog.

Connections
-----------

Each data source has a default connection URI that's initially defined when the data source is first added to Alation. This default connection can only be modified by a Data Source Admin in the data source settings. Anyone can use the default connection as long as they have user credentials for the data source.

Data Source Admins can add more connections that will be available to all users of the data source. Like the default connection, these extra connections can only be modified in the data source settings.

Connections created in the data source settings are called “company connections.”

Individual users can also create their own connection URIs in the Connection Settings dialog. These connections are called “private connections.” Only the person who created them can use them.

Below, you’ll find instructions for:

-  `Editing the default connection`_
-  `Adding a new company connection`_
-  `Adding a new private connection`_
-  `Switching connections`_
-  `Editing a private connection`_
-  `Deleting a private connection`_

6. You’ll be taken back to the **Connection Settings** dialog. Click **Cancel** to exit the dialog.

User Credentials
----------------

Each connection URI has a set of associated user credentials for the data source. When you add new user credentials, they belong to the connection that you have selected. To use the same user credential with different connections, you must add the user separately for each connection.

In some cases, you can only have one user per connection:

-  If you’re connecting to the data source with SSO (single sign-on). In this case the identity provider controls how you  authenticate.
-  If your administrator has enabled transient credentials. In this case Alation does not store your data source credentials, so you can't save extra users.

Below, you’ll find instructions for:

-  `Adding new user credentials without single sign-on`_
-  `Adding new user credentials with single sign-on`_
-  `Switching users`_
-  `Editing user credentials without single sign-on`_
-  `Editing user credentials with single sign-on`_
-  `Deleting user credentials`_

Adding New User Credentials without Single Sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add new user credentials without single sign-on:

1. |Click Connection Settings|

   |Image - Connection Settings|

   |Title and buttons may be different|

2. The user credential you’re about to enter will be linked to the currently selected connection. To link the user with a different connection, click the drop-down next to **Choose a Connection** and choose the desired connection.

3. |Click Connect As|

   |Image - Connect As|

4. Click the **+Add New** option.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_AddNewUser.png

   The Add New Credentials dialog will appear.

5. Enter the user’s **Username** and **Password** for the data source.

6. |Click Save| |Alation tries to authenticate|

   |Back to Connection Settings| If your administrator has enabled `transient user credentials`_, the new user you added will replace any previous users in the drop-down.

7. |Click Set Active Connection|

Adding New User Credentials with Single Sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re connecting to the data source with SSO (single sign-on), Alation will redirect you to the identity provider of your company. If you have already authenticated through the identity provider, and the authentication token is still active, attempting to add a new user will simply reauthenticate with the identity provider. If the token has expired, adding a new user will remove the token and reauthenticate with the identity provider.

An SSO user must be set up in both your identity provider and the data source before you can connect with that user.

To add a new SSO user:

1. |Click Connection Settings|

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_SSO.png

   |Title and buttons may be different|

2. The user you’re about to create will be linked to the currently selected connection. To link the user with a different connection, click the drop-down next to **Choose a Connection** and choose the desired connection.

3. |Click Connect As|

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_SSOConnectAs.png

4. Click the **+Add New (SSO Login)** option.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_SSOAddNewUser.png

   If you have already authenticated with an existing user using SSO, and the authentication token is still active, the existing user will be reauthenticated. You can’t add a new user until the earlier user’s authentication token has expired.

   Otherwise, the login page for your identity provider will open in a new browser tab.

5. Enter your credentials and log into your identity provider.

6. If you have multiple roles in a data source, you may be prompted to select one. For example, in AWS IAM, you will be asked to select the role you want to use in Compose. Select the role and click **Continue**.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_SSORole.png
      :class: with-border

   The browser tab containing your identity provider will close.

7. |Click Set Active Connection|

Switching Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re connecting to the data source with single sign-on (SSO) or if your administrator has enabled `transient user credentials`_, you can only have one user. To switch to a different user in both these situations, you must add a new user instead (see above).

Otherwise your user credentials are saved in Alation.

To switch users (without SSO):

1. |Click Connection Settings|

   |Image - Connection Settings Sriram|

   |Title and buttons may be different|

2. |Click Connect As|

   |Image - Connect As Sriram|

3. Select the user you want to connect with.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_SwitchUser.png

   If you’re connecting with SSO, click the pencil icon. This will open a new tab where you can use your identity provider to sign in with a different user.

4. |Click Set Active Connection| Alation will automatically authenticate the user against the current data source.

Editing User Credentials without Single Sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your user credentials for a data source are saved in Alation, you can edit them. To edit stored user credentials:

1. |Click Connection Settings|

   |Image - Connection Settings Sriram|

   |Title and buttons may be different|

2. |Click Connect As|

   |Image - Connect As Sriram|

3. Click the pencil icon next to the user you want to edit.

   |Image - Edit User|

   The **Edit Credentials** dialog will appear.

4. Edit the user’s **Username** and **Password** as desired.

5. Click the **Update** button. |Alation tries to authenticate|

   |Back to Connection Settings|

6. |Click Set Active Connection|

Editing User Credentials with Single Sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re connecting to a data source with SSO (single sign-on), Alation doesn’t store the username or password of data source users. This means that you can’t edit a data source user’s username or password from Alation. Attempting to edit an SSO user for a data source will open your identity provider’s login window. There you can log in with a different user if desired. See `Switching Users`_ for instructions.

Deleting User Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Alation is configured to store data source credentials, you can delete user credentials:

1. |Click Connection Settings|

   |Image - Connection Settings Sriram|

   |Title and buttons may be different| |Auth  message for SSO|

2. |Click Connect As| If you’ve never connected before, the menu will say **Select**. Otherwise it will show the username of the last user you connected with.

   |Image - Connect As Sriram|

3. Click the pencil icon next to the user you want to delete.

   |Image - Edit User|

   The **Edit Credentials** dialog will appear.

4. Click the **Delete Credential** link.

   .. image:: ../../_static/ConnectionSettings_DeleteCredential.png

5. A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Delete** to continue with deleting the user credentials.

6. You’ll be taken back to the Connection Settings dialog. |Click Set Active Connection|
