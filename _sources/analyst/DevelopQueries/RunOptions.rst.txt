When working on a query in Compose, you have several options for running your query:

- Run all statements in the query at once
- Run the selected text
- Run the query as a script

Run All Statements at Once
--------------------------

Clicking the **Run** button in the query editor will submit each statement, one at a time, to the database. You can also click the arrow in the **Run** button and select **Run Full Query** from the dropdown menu.

Run Selected Text
------------------

Highlighting a section of your query and clicking **Run** allows you to
execute a select part of your code. In other words, highlighting will
limit the query run to the selected section. If a section is
highlighted, a **Run Selected Text** option will appear in the **Run** dropdown
menu. 

Run as Script
--------------

Running a query as a script can only be done on SQL Server. It submits all
the text as one script and should be used for SQL variables, volatile
tables and User-defined Functions (UDFs).

To run a query as a script, click the arrow in the **Run** button and select **Run Full Query as Script** from the dropdown menu.
