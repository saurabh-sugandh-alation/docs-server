Schedule Queries
================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

You can schedule a query to run automatically on a regular basis. At the specified times, the query will automatically execute and generate a new results page.

This feature can be enabled or disabled by a Server Admin. See :doc:`/admins/AdditionalConfiguration/EnableOrDisableQueryScheduling` for instructions.

Starting in 2022.2, the latest results of the scheduled query will always be available at a persistent link. In addition, you can share this persistent link with individual users and groups.

Starting in 2023.1, Server Admins can manage all scheduled queries using a dedicated dashboard. See :doc:`/admins/AdminSettings/ManageScheduledQueries` for details.

Prerequisites for Scheduling a Query
------------------------------------

To schedule a query, certain prerequisites must be met:

- Only the query owner can set up the query’s schedule. Owners and Server Admins can change or disable the schedule once it’s set up. Users designated as query authors can view the schedule but can’t change it.

- Queries must be published before they can be scheduled. If you edit a scheduled query without publishing the change, only the latest published version will run on the schedule. If you unpublish a scheduled query, the schedule will be disabled.

- You can't schedule queries if :doc:`transient credentials </analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/TransientUserCredentials>` are enabled. With transient credentials, Alation doesn't store your data source credentials. This makes it so you have to enter your credentials every time a query is run.

Effect of Time Zones on Scheduled Queries
-----------------------------------------

Times are shown according to your local time as determined by your browser and operating system but stored on our server subject to the Daylight Savings Time policies in effect for most of North America, namely the United States, Canada, and several island nations, including Bermuda and Cuba.

The implication of this is that on the second Sunday in March, the server clock will be advanced by one hour. On the first Sunday in November, the server clock will be reverted back one hour.

Schedule a Query
----------------

The process for scheduling a query changed significantly in 2022.2. Follow the instructions for your version below.

Schedule a Query in 2022.2 and Later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 1: Enable the Query's Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Open the query in Compose.

2. In the toolbar, click the **Schedule** button.

   .. note::

      If the button is disabled:

      -  You may need to :doc:`publish </analyst/WriteQueries/QueryPublishing>` the query. Only published queries can be scheduled.
      -  You may not be the owner of the query. To check if you are the owner, in Compose click the **More** button, then click **Query Access** and see if you have “Owner” to the right of your name. If you aren’t the owner, you can ask the owner to schedule it or :doc:`clone the query </analyst/DevelopQueries/CloneQueries>` and then schedule the clone.
      -  Your administrator may have enabled :doc:`transient credentials </analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/TransientUserCredentials>`. You can't schedule queries when transient credentials is enabled.

   The **Scheduled Query Settings** dialog opens.

3. Click the **Save** button when you’re done setting the connection. Compose will verify that the connection and credentials work. If there’s a problem connecting, you’ll have to update the connection information.

Step 4: Share the Query Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. To share the latest results of the scheduled query with others, click the arrow in the **Sharing Settings** section.

2. For **Page Title**, enter the title you want to be displayed on the catalog page where the query results will be available.

3. Under **Your Master Scheduled Results URL** you will see the persistent link where the latest results of the scheduled query will always be displayed. The link will automatically be sent to users you select in this dialog, but you can also click **Copy Link** if you want to easily paste it somewhere.

4. Choose whether to make the scheduled query’s results **Public** or **Private**.

5. Under **Share Scheduled Query Results With**, click the plus button, then search for a user or group you want to share with.

6. Under **Include a note (optional)**, add a message that will be included in the email sent to the people you’re sharing with.

.. _Cron-Expressions:

Cron Expressions
----------------

This section gives a brief introduction to writing cron expressions for Compose’s advanced scheduler. Cron was originally a utility developed for Unix-like systems to enable tasks to run on a schedule. There are now many implementations of cron. Compose uses an implementation developed by `Celery <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/celery.schedules.html>`_. This implementation is more limited than many others but still provides a lot of power.

Cron expressions let you define complex schedules such as:

- Every Monday and Friday at 2am and 4am
- Twice a month on the 1st and 15th
- Every three hours on the weekends

The Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each cron expression consists of five fields separated by a space. Each field specifies a different aspect of the schedule.

``<minutes> <hours> <days-of-the-month> <months> <days-of-the-week>``

As an example, the following cron expression would run at 12:30pm on the first day of every month.

``30 12 1 * *``

The Fields
~~~~~~~~~~

The fields are described in the following table.

.. |Special characters| replace:: ``, - * /``

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Allowed Values
     - Allowed Special Characters
   * - Minutes
     - ``0–59``
     - |Special characters|
   * - Hours
     - ``0–23``
     - |Special characters|
   * - Days of the Month
     - ``1–31``
     - |Special characters|
   * - Months
     - ``1–12`` or ``JAN–DEC``
     - |Special characters|
   * - Days of the Week
     - ``0–6`` or ``SUN–SAT``
     - |Special characters|

Special Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The special characters let you enter lists, ranges, wildcards, and increments in your cron expression. The special characters are described in the following table.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Special Character
     - Purpose
   * - ``,`` Comma
     - Specifies a list of values.
   * - ``-`` Hyphen
     - Specifies a range of values.
   * - ``*`` Asterisk
     - Specifies all possible values for a field.
   * - ``/`` Slash
     - Specifies every X increments of the given field. For example, 5/15 in the minute field means minutes 5, 20, 35, and 50.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Here are some more examples to help illustrate some of the syntax of cron expressions.

**Example 1**

Let’s say you want a query to run twice a month at 2:15am. You could use this cron expression:

``15 2 1,15 * *``

This cron expression will run at minute 15 of the second hour of the day, on the first and fifteenth days of the month, every month, on any day of the week.

**Example 2**

Let’s say you want a query to run every three hours on weekdays. You could use this cron expression:

``0 */3 * * MON-FRI``

This cron expression will run at minute 0 every 3 hours, on any day of the month, every month, Monday through Friday.
