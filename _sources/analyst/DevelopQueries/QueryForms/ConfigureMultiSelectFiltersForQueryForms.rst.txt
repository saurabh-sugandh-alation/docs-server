Configure Multi-Select Filters For Query Forms
==================================================

*Applies from release 2021.3*

When creating queries in Compose, analysts can configure parameterized filters to be multi-select fields on the corresponding *Query Form* so that users working with the form in the Catalog can take advantage of selecting values from a list instead of entering them manually.

When you go to the **Run Form** catalog page of a parameterized query, the query parameters are displayed in the **Filter Results** section. For example, the query form shown below contains a field for manually entering the filter value:

This query form allows entering a **single value**, which in this example is a TV show name. The underlying query behind this query form includes a parameterized filter for the ``primary_title`` column and looks as follows:

    .. code-block:: console

        SELECT
           primary_title,
           original_title,
           start_year,
           end_year
        FROM IMDb.titles
        WHERE primary_title = ${TV Show Name | eg: The Big Bang Theory | help: Enter TV Show Name}
        AND title_type = 'tvSeries';


The parameterized filter in this query -

    .. code-block:: console

        WHERE primary_title = ${TV Show Name | eg: The Big Bang Theory | help: Enter TV Show Name}

defines the filter field that appears on the corresponding query form.

In order to allow users to select multiple values instead of manually entering a single name, the syntax of the filter can be modified in the following way:

    - Use ``IN`` as the predicate operator (or ``NOT IN`` starting in 2022.1)
    - In the *example* section of the parameterized filter, - the ``eg`` parameter, - list specific column values wrapping them in single quotes:

    .. code-block:: console

        WHERE primary_title IN (${TV Show Name | eg: 'The Big Bang Theory', 'Star Trek', 'House' | help: Enter TV Show Name})

This will add a multi-select option to the filter field on the query form:

It is possible to add more than one filter to a query form. In the following example, the query has been modified to include two multi-select filters:

    .. code-block:: console

          SELECT
            primary_title,
            original_title,
            start_year,
            end_year
          FROM IMDb.titles
          WHERE primary_title IN (${TV Show Name |eg: 'The Big Bang Theory', 'Star Trek', 'House' | help: Enter TV Show Name})
          AND start_year IN (${Year Started | eg: '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020', '2021' | type: date | help: Enter the Year of the Show})
          AND title_type = 'tvSeries';


Note that if the variable type is defined with the ``type`` parameter, the input field on the query form will reflect the variable type. For example, for the **Year Started** filter in the example, the variable type is set to ``date``, and the input field on the query form will appear as a *date picker* type of field instead of a text field:

    .. code-block:: console

          AND start_year IN (${Year Started | eg: '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020', '2021' | type: date | help: Enter the Year of the Show})


 Users will see a date picker widget when they click on the field to enter values:
