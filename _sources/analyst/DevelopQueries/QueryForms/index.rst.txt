Query forms make queries into a self-service activity for those who can’t write their own queries. With query forms, you can run a query many times using different filter options—without writing any code. 

For example, you could have a query that gets data on a particular state for a given month. If you turn the query into a query form, users could enter the state and month into a form and click a button to run the query using the information they entered. They don’t have to edit the query.

Query forms are catalog pages where you can view a query, enter your filter options into a simple form, and run the query using the values you entered. The query form results are only visible to the user who ran the form. See :doc:`/analyst/DevelopQueries/QueryForms/WorkingWithQueryFormInTheCatalog` for details.

To create a query form, the query author adds parameters to the query using a special syntax. See :doc:`/analyst/DevelopQueries/QueryForms/QueryFormsandParameters` for a description of the parameter syntax.

All queries can be viewed as a query form page, even if the query author hasn’t added any parameters to it. The user won’t be able to enter any values, but they can still run the query.

Access and Permission for Query Forms
-------------------------------------

To see and use a query form page, you must have:

- Run access or higher to the query (see :doc:`/analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/index` for more details on access levels and how to change them).
- Credentials for the data source the query will run against (see :doc:`/analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/index` for more help).
- The Explorer or Composer role in Alation, depending on your Alation version (see :doc:`Roles Overview</welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>` for more on roles). You will need:

  - The Explorer role in 2023.1 and later for Alation Cloud Service on our cloud-native architecture
  - The Composer role in all other versions
