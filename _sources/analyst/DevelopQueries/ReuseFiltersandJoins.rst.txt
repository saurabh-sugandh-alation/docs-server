=====================================================================

Alation learns from you every time you run a query. If you join tables
or use a data expression, Alation will automatically pick it up and
enable you to save it for quick reuse.

On the table **Catalog** page, all previously used JOIN clauses are on
the **Joins** tab. Data expressions are on the **Filters** tab.

Any filter or join can be saved and named for quick reuse in Compose.

For example, another user saved the filter **northeast** to include a set of Northeastern states:

Now you can type the term **northeast** instead of manually typing
out each state and risk using the wrong definition. Saved filters allow
analysts to save time and enhances the accuracy of your data.
