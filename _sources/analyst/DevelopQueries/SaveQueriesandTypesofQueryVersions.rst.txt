Autosaving
----------

Compose now autosaves all edits to a query. This means you do not
have to perform that Save action manually because all your work is saved
automatically.

Autosaving creates a minor version of your query that will be added
to **Query Version History**. A minor version is a part of changes to
your query that is captured by the autosave.

A manual save or a hotkey save will produce a minor version, too.

Major and Minor Versions in Version History
-------------------------------------------

In **Version History**, users can see the details on how their query has
changed over time. For the query author, **Version History** displays
both major and minor versions of a query.

A major version of a query is created when this query is published.

Minor versions are created when ongoing edits to a query are saved.
In **Version History**, minor versions are grouped under the major version
or the current version.

.. note::

     Minor versions, or unpublished autosaved edits, are only visible to
     query authors. Non-authors only see major versions in **Version History**.
