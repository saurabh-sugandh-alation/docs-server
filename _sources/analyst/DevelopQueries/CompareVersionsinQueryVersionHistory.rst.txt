*Available from Version V R5 (5.9.x)*

In Query Version History in Compose, you can compare major versions.
A major version is a query version that was published.

Comparing Query Versions
------------------------

To compare versions,

1. In Compose, open Version History for a query by clicking **Moreâ€¦** on the upper right then clicking **Version History**.
2. The list of versions on the left will have the current query version selected. Select a different version if you want. The query version you select will be one for the versions for comparison.
3. On the top toolbar, click **Compare**. The Compare Versions dialog will open.
4. From the list of versions, select the second version you want to compare. The name of the version you have selected previously will be disabled.

5. In the dialog, click Compare. The diff view of the two versions will open, and the differences will be highlighted with color.

Diff View
---------

The diff view always shows what is added or removed since the time
of the oldest of the selected versions, so it does not matter in
which order you select the versions for comparison.

The top toolbar of the diff view area will tell you which versions are
being compared. New additions are highlighted in green. Deleted parts are
highlighted in red and crossed out.

Actions Available to Authors in Diff View
-----------------------------------------

As the query *author*, you will notice that there are actions
available to you on the Diff view. The type of action will depend on the
version you have selected first in the Version History viewer.

-  If you have selected the most recent, or *Current*, version that
   has unpublished edits, you will have the Republish action.
-  If you have selected an older major version, you will have
   the **Restore** action available right from the diff.

For details on republishing and restoring, see :doc:`Query Version History <../../analyst/DevelopQueries/QueryVersionHistory>` (Beta).

Diff View Toolbar, when the current version with unpublished edits is selected first, Republish is available:
