Cloning Queries
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from Version V R5 (5.9.x)*

In Alation, you cannot jump in and edit somebody else’s query if
you have not been invited to collaborate, but you can clone a query
as your own and edit your own copy. Both query authors and non-authors
can clone a query.

.. note::

    Clone is the new name of the Save As button from previous
    Alation versions that keeps the Save As functionality.

To clone a query, 

#. Open a query in Compose. For non-authors, the Clone button will be available on the Compose toolbar. If you are an author who has opened their own query, the Clone button will be under the **More …** menu on upper right.
#. Click **Clone**. Your copy of the query will be created.
