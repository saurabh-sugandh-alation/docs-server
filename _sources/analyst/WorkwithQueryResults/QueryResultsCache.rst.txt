Query Results Cache
=====================================================================

Each time you run a query, Alation caches the resulting output by default. Alation automatically saves a result page in the catalog. You can view the catalog result page by clicking **More** > **View in Catalog** in the **Results** tab.

Automatic caching depends on the size of the query result. By default:

 -  All Results < 1 MB are automatically saved forever unless you delete them.

 -  Results > 1 MB and < 16 MB are saved for the next seven days. If you want to save a result forever,  click the **Preserve Data** link in the **Results** tab.
 
-  For query results > 16 MB, the first 16 MB worth of rows will be stored. If you select **Download**, only the first 16 MB of rows will be downloaded.

A Server Admin can manually purge saved query results as well as :doc:`change the default behavior </admins/AdditionalConfiguration/PurgingQueryResults>` in the following ways:

- The size threshold for automatically saving query results can be changed.

- The length of time results < 16 MB are saved can be changed.

- Automatic caching of results can be disabled entirely.
