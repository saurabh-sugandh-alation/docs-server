Manage Sharing of Query Results
===============================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

By default query results are private to the person who ran the query. Query results can be shared publicly or privately.

-  **Public** means everyone can see the query results, as long as they have access to the underlying data source and view access to the query itself.

-  **Private** means only the individuals or groups you specify can see the query results.

Based on your organization’s policies, you may want to disable public sharing or query results or disable sharing completely.

In 2023.3 and newer, Data Source Admins can control how query results are shared for individual data sources. In 2023.1.7 and older, Server Admins can control how query results are shared the entire catalog.

Sharing settings apply anywhere query results can be shared:

-  In the **Results** tab in Compose

-  On the query results catalog page

-  On the **Scheduled Query Settings** modal

The way to manage sharing of query results depends on the version of Alation.

.. _manage-sharing-2023-3-and-newer:

2023.3 and Newer
----------------

Data Source Admins can control how query results are shared for individual data sources:

1. Go to the data source settings page:

   -  Click on **Apps** > **Sources**.

   -  Click **Manage Settings**, then click the wrench icon for the data source.

2. Click the **Compose** tab if there is one (OCF data sources), otherwise click the **General Settings** tab (native data sources).

3. Find the **Query Result Sharing** section and choose what level of sharing you’d like for this data source.

   -  **No Sharing Allowed**—The sharing option will be completely disabled everywhere. Query results will always be private to the user who ran the query.

   -  **Allow Private Sharing Of Compose Results only**—The **Public** sharing option will be disabled everywhere. Query results can still be shared privately with specific users or groups.

   -  **Allow Private and Public Sharing Of Compose Results**—The **Public** and **Private** options will both be enabled everywhere. This is the default.

Alation Cloud Service customers can request this change by submitting a ticket to Alation Support.

Server Admins for on-premises (customer managed) instances of Alation can use the instructions below:

1. In Alation, click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner. This opens the **Admin Settings** page.

2. Click **Compose Settings**.

3. Click the **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** toggle to enable or disable public sharing.

.. _upgrading-to-2023.3-1:

Upgrading to 2023.3
-------------------

Upon upgrading to 2023.3 or later, the global **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** toggle in the Admin Settings will be removed and will no longer be used. All data sources will have the **Query Result Sharing** setting automatically set based on the value of **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** at the time of the upgrade:

-  If the toggle is enabled (this is the default), then **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** will be set to **Allow Private and Public Sharing Of Compose Results** for all data sources.

-  If the toggle is disabled, then **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** will be set to **Allow Private Sharing Of Compose Results only** for all data sources.

After the upgrade, Data Source Admins can freely set **Query Result Sharing** for each of their data sources. See :ref:`above <manage-sharing-2023-3-and-newer>` for instructions.
