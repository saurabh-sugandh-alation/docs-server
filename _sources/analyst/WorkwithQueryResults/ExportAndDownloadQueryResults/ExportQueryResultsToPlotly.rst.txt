Alation integrates directly with Plot.ly so you can easily send your query results to the tool for creation of plots, visualizations, and dashboards.

Plot.ly must be enabled on your company’s instance of Alation. If you don’t see it listed and are interested in this integration, contact your Alation Server Admin.

Enabling Plot.ly Export
--------------------------

The role of a Server Admin is required for enabling export to Plot.ly. If storing created visualizations is desired, an account with Plot.ly will also be necessary.

1.  Select the **Settings** icon on the upper-right area of the page.
2.  Select **Miscellaneous** in the Server Admin section.
3.  Toggle the Plot.ly Integration slider to the **On** position.
