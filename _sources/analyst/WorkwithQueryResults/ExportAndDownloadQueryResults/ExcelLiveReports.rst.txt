Excel Live Reports are a refreshable XLS workbook backed by a
connection to a query that can be updated from in Excel with a
single click.

Found under the Share button in Compose, this feature allows you to
unite the Alation query writing and cataloging capabilities with Excel's
formulas and charting to explore data more deeply on your own, or to
share results with your colleagues so they're empowered to be truly
self-service when they want the most up-to-date numbers (so your boss
who neither knows SQL nor even has a username for the DB can see the
latest figures without bothering you)!
