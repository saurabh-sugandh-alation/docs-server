When you :doc:`schedule a query </analyst/DevelopQueries/ScheduleQueries>`, you will be notified by email when the query starts to run and when your results are ready. Follow the link in your email to view the catalog page with your query results.

The results of scheduled queries are subject to the same rules described in :doc:`/analyst/WorkwithQueryResults/SaveQueryResults`.

If your result set is larger than the configured maximum size, you will need to export your results to get the entire result set. However, exports cannot be scheduled because computers don't support offline downloads. See :doc:`/analyst/WorkwithQueryResults/ExportAndDownloadQueryResults/index` for help exporting your results.
