Configuring Query Result Size
=====================================================================

*Available from version V R5 (5.9.x)*

Some of the Compose queries can generate oversized result tables, and
may even reach the query execution result size limit. In this case the
query results will only be partially retrieved into the result table in
Compose.

.. note::

     The full results can still be viewed in the query data export.

If analysts need to run or schedule queries producing large result
tables that are trimmed by the default size limit, the result size
can be increased in **Compose Settings** section of **Admin Settings**.
The result size is increased by allowing more space on the Alation
server for storing the result tables.

This action requires the role of a **Server Admin**.

To increase query result size,

#. Log in to Alation and in the upper-right corner, click the **Admin Settings** icon to open the Admin Settings page:

#. In the **Admin Settings** area, click **Compose Settings**.

#. On Compose Settings tab, find the parameter **Maximum Result Size in Megabytes**. The default value is 16 MB, but you can increase this value to the maximum of 100 MB. You can start by doubling the default size and setting the limit to 32MB.
#. On top right, click **Save changes** to apply the change.

Increasing the result size limit will allow more rows to be retrieved by queries in Compose.

Large execution results may take time to load. If that is the
case, you will see the streaming results message on both the results
pane in Compose and on the result table and query form pages in the
catalog. Until the query is complete, the export functionality will not be available.

In Compose, there is also a counter of rows that are loaded so far.

.. note::

     Depending on your Alation instance setup, increasing the result size
     limit may cause a decline in Alation performance when multiple users
     simultaneously run queries which render large result sets.
