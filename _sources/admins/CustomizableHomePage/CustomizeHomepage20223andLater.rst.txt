Role-Based Homepages - 2022.3 and Later
=======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from version 2022.3 and Later*

Overview
--------

The *customizable homepage* feature enables admins to customize the appearance and content of the Alation homepage. For example, you can add your company’s branding, change the search banner, add custom links, and provide object previews. By customizing the homepage, you can highlight unique catalog content for specific user roles and make it easier to discover catalog information. This facilitates broader adoption of the Alation catalog.

In 2022.3 and newer, you can create unique homepages for different user roles in your organization. When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their :doc:`role </welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>` is assigned to.

To customize the Alation homepage, you must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin.

Customization Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make the following changes to a custom homepage:

-  Customize the search banner

   -  Change the banner size

   -  Change the background color or background image

   -  Change the logo

   -  Change the headline text and color

-  Edit the links in the Quick Links section

-  Add new content sections to the bottom of the homepage, including:

   -  Custom link lists

   -  Object previews

   -  Alation Analytics V2 Leaderboard

.. note::

   You can also add an alert banner to the homepage. You can only set one alert, and it appears on all homepages. See :doc:`/admins/AdminSettings/AlertBanner` for more information.

Work with Homepages
----------------------

You can use the **Custom Homepages** dashboard to create, edit, enable, disable, duplicate, and delete homepages. You must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin to work with custom homepages.

The Alation Default Homepage will always be available on the dashboard. It can’t be disabled, edited, or deleted. All user roles that aren’t assigned to a role-based homepage will see the Alation Default Homepage.

On a new instance of Alation, all user roles will be assigned to the Alation Default Homepage to start off. You can create new homepages and assign user roles to them as desired.

If you're upgrading Alation to 2022.3 and you've already customized your homepage, the upgrade process will convert it to a role-based homepage. It will be named “Migrated Homepage,” and every user role will be assigned to it.

To work with role-based homepages:

1. Click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner.

   .. image:: ../../_static/TopNavigationBar_Gear.png


2. | *Catalog Admins:* A dropdown menu appears. Click **Customize Homepage**.
   | *Server Admins:* The Admin Settings page appears. Under the **Catalog Admin** section, click **Customize Homepage**.

3. The **Custom Homepages** dashboard appears.

   .. image:: ../../_static/CustomHomepagesDashboard.png
      :class: with-border

   .. note:: Dashboard Sort Order

      The dashboard is sorted first by the enabled state, with enabled dashboards at the top. Then it's sorted by the last updated date, with more recently updated dashboards at the top. You will see your homepages resort themselves as you update them or change their enabled status.

4. You can now take one of the following actions to manage your role-based homepages.

New Homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new homepage from scratch, click the **+ New Homepage** button. Alation will create a new homepage and immediately open the homepage editor. See `Edit a Homepage`_ for help editing.

To go back to the Custom Homepages dashboard, click **Homepages** in the breadcrumbs menu near the top of the page.

Download Active JSON File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your custom homepage’s quick links, custom link lists, and object previews are defined by a JSON file. To download the file, click the three dots on the far right, then select **Download Active JSON File**. The file will immediately download to your computer.

.. note::

   The Alation Default Homepage can’t be deleted.

Edit a Homepage
---------------

The following sections provide the details of customizing each part of a role-based homepage starting in 2022.3. Your changes are saved automatically as you edit.

Title
~~~~~

Starting in 2022.3, with role-based homepages, each homepage has its own title. The title is shown on the **Custom Homepages** dashboard to help identify each dashboard. Untitled homepages will be listed as “Untitled Homepage [#]”. The title is not shown to catalog users when visiting the homepage itself.

Audience Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 2022.3, each role-based homepage can be assigned to one or more roles. ​​When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their role is assigned to.

Click the **Select Roles** dropdown menu and select the roles you want to assign to this homepage. You can use the **Select All** option to select all roles, or use the **Clear** link to deselect all roles. You must select at least one role before you can enable the homepage.

If the homepage is currently enabled and you select a role that’s already assigned to another homepage, you’ll see a message asking if you want to change the role assignment.

-  Click **Overwrite Assignments** to proceed with changing their assignment. The role will be unassigned from their prior homepage and reassigned to this homepage.

-  Click **Cancel** to leave its existing assignment as is. The role will not be assigned to this homepage.

If you remove all roles from the homepage, the **Enable Homepage** toggle will automatically become disabled. You must assign at least one role to a homepage before you can enable it.

Preview
~~~~~~~

Starting in 2022.4, while you’re editing the homepage, click **Preview** in the top right corner to see a preview of what the homepage will look like. This is superior to the preview shown next to the Search Banner section of the homepage editor because it shows the entire homepage, not just the search banner.

When the preview opens, you’ll see a banner at the top of the screen to remind you that you’re looking at a preview. While in preview mode you can navigate around in Alation to see what any given page looks like.

To enable or disable the homepage from preview mode, click the **Enable Homepage** toggle. See `Enable Homepage`_ below for details on enabling a homepage.

Click **Close Preview** at the top of the screen when you’re done looking at the preview. You’ll be returned to the homepage editor screen.

Enable Homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the **Enable Homepage** toggle in the top right corner to enable (or disable) the homepage. You must select at least one role under **Audience Settings** before you can enable the homepage.

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/EnableAHomepage.rst

Search Banner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search banner is the topmost section of the homepage. You can customize the following features of the search banner:

-  Size (large, medium, or small)

-  Background (color or image)

-  Logo

-  Headline (text and color)

When changing the search banner settings, a preview is available on the right side of the page.

Size
^^^^

Under the **Search Banner** section, find the **Size** heading, then select the desired size. The preview to the right will update to show the effects of your choice.

-  **Large**—This is the default. It includes the logo, headline, and search box centered on a large banner. The logo is 60 px in height.

-  **Medium**—The logo is 40 px in height and appears in the top left corner. The banner is shorter.

-  **Small**—The logo is 40 px in height and appears in the top left corner. The logo will be the one chosen on the :doc:`Branding </admins/AdminSettings/Branding>` page. The banner and headline are removed. The search box appears in the top toolbar like it does on regular catalog pages.

   .. note::

      When you select the small banner, the **Background**, **Logo**, and **Headline** sections of the homepage editor disappear. They aren’t relevant for the small banner.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

If you chose the medium or large search banner, you can find the **Background** heading under the **Search Banner** section of the homepage editor.

Select whether you want to use your theme color or an image.

-  **Theme Color**—This will use the theme color you have defined on the **Branding** page. See :doc:`/admins/AdminSettings/Branding` for help changing the theme color.

-  **Image (Upload)**—If you select this, a dotted rectangle will appear. Drag and drop an image into the rectangle, or click inside the rectangle to select an image from your hard drive.

   .. note::

      The image must be in JPEG, JPG, or PNG format and must be at least 1200 x 350 pixels in size. The maximum file size is 5 MB.

   The new banner image will appear on the homepage as soon as it’s finished uploading. Users may have to refresh their screen to see the new image.

.. note::

   If you chose the small search banner, this setting will not be present.

Logo
^^^^

If you chose the medium or large search banner, you can find the **Logo** heading under the **Search Banner** section of the homepage editor.

By default, the search banner uses the Alation logo. To change this, drag and drop an image into the dotted rectangle, or click inside the rectangle to select an image from your hard drive.

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/LogoSize.rst

The new logo will appear on the homepage as soon as it’s finished uploading. Users may have to refresh their screen to see it.

The new logo is applicable only to the homepage. To change the existing catalog branding logo, go to **Admin Settings** > **Branding**. See :doc:`/admins/AdminSettings/Branding` for more help.

.. note::

   If you chose the small search banner, this setting will not be present.

Headline
^^^^^^^^

If you chose the medium or large search banner, you can find the **Headline** heading under the **Search Banner** section of the homepage editor.

To change the headline text, hover over the current headline text and click the **Edit** icon.

To change the headline color, hover over the hex code and click the **Edit** icon. Be sure to choose a color that provides good contrast against your chosen background.

.. note::

   If you chose the small search banner, this setting will not be present.

Custom Content and Quick Links
------------------------------

To edit the Quick Links or add custom content to a homepage, you’ll have to prepare a configuration file in JSON format.

Step 1: Gather the Needed Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may be helpful to first gather the information needed to fill out the JSON file. Each section of the JSON file requires certain data to function correctly. The following table describes what information is needed for each type of change.

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Section**            | **Required Information**                                                 |
+=======================+==========================================================================+
| Quick Links           |   - Link titles                                                          |
|                       |   - URLs                                                                 |
|                       |   - Images (Choose from available object type images,                    |
|                       |     or upload custom images. See `Use Custom Thumbnail Images`_.)        |
|                       |   - Whether the link should open in a new tab (2022.2 and newer)         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Custom Link Lists     |   - Link titles                                                          |
|                       |   - Link descriptions                                                    |
|                       |   - URLs                                                                 |
|                       |   - Images (Choose from available object type images,                    |
|                       |     or upload custom images. See `Use Custom Thumbnail Images`_.)        |
|                       |   - Whether the link should open in a new tab (2022.2 and newer)         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Object Preview        |   - Object type: ``article``, ``bi_report``, or ``tableau_sheet``        |
| Windows               |                                                                          |
|                       |   - Object ID (OID) - Locate the OID in the Alation URL of the           |
|                       |     object page. For example, for an article with the URL                |
|                       |     **https://alationdata.com/article/878/business-areas** the           |
|                       |     OID is **878**                                                       |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. important::

   Some pages in Alation may be restricted by permissions. For example, articles and sources may be private. If links to such objects are added to a homepage, some users will get an error when they click the links. We recommend not adding links to restricted-access objects to the homepage.

Step 2: Download a JSON File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download an existing JSON file from Alation rather than trying to create one from scratch. There are two options:

-  Download the JSON file of an existing homepage. This way you can start with a JSON file you’ve already completed and make any desired changes from there. You can get an existing homepage’s JSON in one of two ways:

   -  On the **Custom Homepages** dashboard, click the three dots to the right of the homepage you want to copy. Then click **Download Active JSON File**.

   -  On the **Custom Homepages** dashboard, click the **Edit** button of the homepage you want to copy. Then scroll down and click the **Download Active JSON File** button.

-  Download the generic JSON template. This gives a sample JSON that you can edit and fill in as desired. You can get the JSON template in one of two ways:

   -  On the **Custom Homepages** dashboard, click the three dots to the right of the Alation Default Homepage. Then click **Download Active JSON File**.

   -  On the **Custom Homepages** dashboard, click the **Edit** button to the right of any homepage. Then click the **Download Blank Template** button.

Step 3: Edit the JSON File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/EditingJSON.rst

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/AlationAnalyticsLeaderboardOnHomepage.rst

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/UseCustomThumbnailImages.rst

Step 4: Upload the JSON to Alation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you aren’t on the homepage editor, go to the **Custom Homepages** dashboard, then click the **Edit** button of the homepage you’re working on.

2. In the homepage editor, scroll down to the bottom of the page.

3. If you want to preserve the old file, you can download it now using the **Download Active File** button.

4. Drag and drop the JSON file into the dotted rectangle at the bottom of the page, or click inside the rectangle to select the file from your computer.

The changes will take effect immediately when the file is done uploading.
