*Applies to version 2023.3.4 and later*

Overview
--------

The *customizable homepage* feature enables admins to customize the appearance and content of the Alation homepage. For example, you can add your company’s branding, change the search banner, add custom links, and provide object previews. By customizing the homepage, you can highlight unique catalog content for specific user types and make it easier to discover catalog information. This facilitates broader adoption of the Alation catalog.

In 2023.3.4 and newer, you can create unique homepages for different user groups in your organization. For example, a user group representing a business unit or organization can have its own dedicated homepage.

When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their user group is assigned to. If the user belongs to multiple groups that each have a homepage, the user can choose which homepage to use. See the :doc:`/welcome/CatalogBasics/CustomizableHomePage` topic for more information on choosing homepage preferences.

To customize the Alation homepage, you must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin.

Work with Homepages
----------------------

You can use the **Custom Homepages** dashboard to create, edit, enable, disable, duplicate, and delete homepages. You must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin to work with custom homepages.

The Alation Default Homepage will always be available on the dashboard. It can’t be disabled, edited, or deleted. All users that aren’t assigned to a homepage will see the Alation Default Homepage.

On a new instance of Alation, all users will be assigned to the Alation Default Homepage to start off. You can create new homepages and assign user groups to them as desired.

To work with homepages:

.. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/NavigateToHomepageDashboard.rst

#. The **Custom Homepages** dashboard appears.

   .. include:: /shared/CustomizableHomepage/DashboardSortOrder.rst

   .. note:: 

      The **Created With** column indicates how a homepage was last modified. Homepages edited using the graphical user interface in the new user experience will say **GUI** in the **Created With** column. Homepages edited in the classic editor with JSON files will say **JSON**. Homepages that haven’t been edited since the 2023.3.4 release will say **Legacy**.

Audience Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 2023.3.4, each homepage can be assigned to one or more user groups. ​​When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their user group is assigned to. If they are a member of multiple user groups with different homepages, they will be able to choose which homepage to use and can freely switch between their available homepages. See the :doc:`/welcome/CatalogBasics/CustomizableHomePage` topic for more information.

Click the **Select Groups** dropdown menu and select the user groups you want to assign to this homepage. You must select at least one group before you can enable the homepage.

If the homepage is currently enabled and you select a group that’s already assigned to another homepage, you’ll see a message asking if you want to change the group’s assignment.

-  Click **Overwrite Assignments** to proceed with changing their assignment. The group will be unassigned from their prior homepage and reassigned to this homepage.

-  Click **Cancel** to leave its existing assignment as is. The group will not be assigned to this homepage.

If you remove all groups from the homepage, the **Enable Homepage** toggle will automatically become disabled. You must assign at least one group to a homepage before you can enable it.

Migrate from Role-Based Homepages
---------------------------------

If you’re upgrading Alation to 2023.3.4 or later and currently have role-based homepages, each role-based homepage will automatically be converted to a corresponding group-based homepage. These migrated homepages will automatically become preferred homepages for each user. See the :doc:`/welcome/CatalogBasics/CustomizableHomePage` topic for more on preferred homepages.

.. note::

   Each Alation role has a corresponding built-in user group. If desired, you can continue to have role-based homepages using the built-in user groups.
