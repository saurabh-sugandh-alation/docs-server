*Applies from version 2022.3 to 2023.3.3*

Overview
--------

The *customizable homepage* feature enables admins to customize the appearance and content of the Alation homepage. For example, you can add your company’s branding, change the search banner, add custom links, and provide object previews. By customizing the homepage, you can highlight unique catalog content for specific user roles and make it easier to discover catalog information. This facilitates broader adoption of the Alation catalog.

In Alation versions 2022.3 to 2023.3.3, you can create unique homepages for different user roles in your organization. When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their :doc:`role </welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>` is assigned to.

.. note::

   In Alation 2023.3.4 and later, you can create unique homepages for user groups, enabling dedicated homepages for business units or organizations. See :doc:`/admins/CustomizableHomePage/CustomizeHomepage2023_3_4AndLater`.

To customize the Alation homepage, you must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin.

Work with Homepages
----------------------

You can use the **Custom Homepages** dashboard to create, edit, enable, disable, duplicate, and delete homepages. You must be a Server Admin or Catalog Admin to work with custom homepages.

The Alation Default Homepage will always be available on the dashboard. It can’t be disabled, edited, or deleted. All user roles that aren’t assigned to a role-based homepage will see the Alation Default Homepage.

On a new instance of Alation, all user roles will be assigned to the Alation Default Homepage to start off. You can create new homepages and assign user roles to them as desired.

If you're upgrading Alation to 2022.3 and you've already customized your homepage, the upgrade process will convert it to a role-based homepage. It will be named “Migrated Homepage,” and every user role will be assigned to it.

Audience Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each role-based homepage can be assigned to one or more roles. ​​When a user logs into Alation, they will see the homepage their role is assigned to.

Click the **Select Roles** dropdown menu and select the roles you want to assign to this homepage. You can use the **Select All** option to select all roles, or use the **Clear** link to deselect all roles. You must select at least one role before you can enable the homepage.

If the homepage is currently enabled and you select a role that’s already assigned to another homepage, you’ll see a message asking if you want to change the role assignment.

-  Click **Overwrite Assignments** to proceed with changing their assignment. The role will be unassigned from their prior homepage and reassigned to this homepage.

-  Click **Cancel** to leave its existing assignment as is. The role will not be assigned to this homepage.

If you remove all roles from the homepage, the **Enable Homepage** toggle will automatically become disabled. You must assign at least one role to a homepage before you can enable it.
