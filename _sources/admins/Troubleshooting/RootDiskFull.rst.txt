Root Disk is Full
=================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation stores a minimum amount of data on the root partition. Because
this is where binaries are deployed and run from Alation requires 8GB to
be free to deploy new binaries and at least 1GB to be free at all times
to write temporary log files and configuration. If you are experiencing
issues starting up Alation we suggest you check to see if root partition
is full

#. Check if space is available:  df -h /
#. If disk is approaching capacity ie: > 80%, contact your system administrator.
