RPM Installation Error During Update
========================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. note::

   The issue described below was reported on environments using CentOS 8 and RHEL 8.


An attempt to run the RPM install command on the host during Alation update may result in the following error:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        error: alation-<x.y.z.nnnn>.rpm: headerRead failed: hdr data: BAD, no. of bytes(<17415864>) out of range

**Example**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        [root@ip-10-15-28-245 install]# sudo rpm -Uvh alation-7.1.0.128409.rpm
        error: alation-7.1.0.128409.rpm: headerRead failed: hdr data: BAD, no. of bytes(17415864) out of range
        error: alation-7.1.0.128409.rpm cannot be installed


This may point to the outdated RPM version on your environment.

To troubleshoot and continue with the update:

1. On the Alation host, before using the RPM install command, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo yum install rpm -y --skip-broken

2. Run the RPM install command again. You should be able to proceed with the update.
