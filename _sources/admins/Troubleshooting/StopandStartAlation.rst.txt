Stopping and Starting Alation
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

You are not expected to regularly stop and start the Alation services. If there
is an issue, an Alation Support engineer will guide you through the restart process. 

Alation runs in a root jail environment, and access to services in the
Alation environment is through the Alation shell.  You need to have
an account with the ``sudo`` access to the Alation server to run the
commands given below.

Stop Alation
------------

To stop all Alation services:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/alation stop


Start Alation
------------------

To start all Alation services:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/alation start

Accessing individual services and checking the Alation status
------------------------------------------------------------------

To access information on individual services running in the Alation
environment, enter the Alation shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

In the Alation shell you can check status, start, and stop
individual services as follows using one of the actions ``start``, ``stop``, or ``status``:

Postgres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2021.3.x and newer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-13 status | start | stop

V R6 (5.10.x) - 2021.2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-9.6 status | start | stop

Releases Before V R6 (5.10.x)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-9.3 status | start | stop


Other Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/nginx status | start | stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/sensu-client status | start | stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/redis-server status | start | stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/download-client status | start | stop
    alation_supervisor status all

System Reboot
-------------

In Linux distributions that use sysvinit, Alation services are registered with ``chkconfig`` and will be shut down and restarted on reboot. In particular, Debian 9 and 10 may optionally use sysvinit, although they install with systemd by default. Other Linux distributions that Alation supports don't use sysvinit and use systemd instead. On such distributions, you may need to restart Alation services manually after a system reboot.
