When the Alation server starts running out of space, you may receive
reports that jobs are failing due to space constraints.

#. Check the space available:  ``df -h``
#. Delete any lingering installer files if they are crowding the root or home directories
#. Enter the Alation shell:  ``sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell``
#. Change to the logs folder: ``cd /opt/alation/site/logs``
#. Delete the older log files.
#. If backups are not configured to be stored on a separate drive, check for older backups to be deleted.
#. Empty **/opt/alation/site/dumps** if there are any files there. 
#. Go to **/data2/backup** and delete old backup files.
#. Check in **/opt/alation/site/tmp** directories.
#. Delete **/extract_cache** and **/query_ingestion_buffer**.
