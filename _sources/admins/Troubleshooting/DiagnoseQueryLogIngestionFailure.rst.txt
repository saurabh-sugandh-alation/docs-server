=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Issue
--------------

When running a Query Log Ingestion, it either fails to run or does not
complete successfully.  

Cause
---------

There are multiple reasons that could cause query log ingestion to fail.
Because of this, Alation has QLI diagnostics you can run to help obtain
more information about the failure. The tool verifies the configuration,
runs various diagnostics specific to the datasource and provides
information such as the cause, possible fix, and stacktrace.

Resolution
-----------

To troubleshoot and resolve a Query Log Ingestion failure, run the QLI
Diagnostics. 

Supported Datasource Types: Hive2

Below is an example of the QLI diagnostics running against a Hive2 data source.
