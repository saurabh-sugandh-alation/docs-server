Issue: Error 500 on Alation Pages After Restore
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes after a backup restore, during the restore testing, users may
encounter Error 500 on random pages in Alation. We have not discovered
any pattern in this happening, and this issue is rare.

Restoring from a backup is expected to be successful and to not produce
any errors; however, if you run into empty pages with Error 500 after a
restore, please collect the required logs and contact Alation Support to handle the issue and perform reindexing of individual tables that cause the error.

Finding Logs
--------------

The logs with this particular error will be in the **uwsgi.log**, located inside the Alation Chroot
at **/opt/alation/site/logs/**.

**Example error text to look for in the logs**: ``...unexpected zero page at block...``.

    .. code-block:: console

        INFO Exception at CeleryJobLog: task_sent, task_id:
        ace8c2c0-a9f8-4a90-999e-5bf55863ac08.
        INFO Exception_class: <class
        'django.db.utils.InternalError'>,Message: index
        "celery_job_monitor_celeryjo_return_status_2495eb60d8e08f4d_like"
        has unexpected zero page at block 1328
        HINT: REINDEX it.


You can tail the **uwsgi.log** while reproducing the issue in Alation UI (open the page that throws Error 500):

1. Enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo service alation shell

2. To tail **uwsgi.log**:

    .. code-block:: bash

        tail -f  /opt/alation/site/logs/uwsgi.log

        :width: 5.5in
        :align: center

.. note::

    The index table name that requires reindexing will appear in the error message:

    Example:

      .. code-block:: console

          ...Message: index "celery_job_monitor_celeryjoblog_6d99c442" has
          unexpected zero page at block 1351…

    In this example: ``Celery_job_monitor_celeryjoblog_6d99c442`` is the name of the index table that needs reindexing. There may be more than one table that require reindexing.

Other Required Logs
----------------------

In addition to the **uwsgi.log**, please collect:

    - the Postgres logs: inside the Alation Chroot: **/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/pgstartup.log** and **/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data/pg_log**

    - the Alation logs **alation-error.log**, **alation-info.log**, **alation-debug.log** at **/opt/alation/site/logs/** inside the Alation Chroot.
