2023.3.x Upgrade Fails Due to Postgres Not Starting
========================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

Problem
----------------

The upgrade to 2023.3.1 or a later minor version of 2023.3 fails due to Postgres failing to start and an error in the Postgres logs that is similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        runuser: warning: cannot change directory to /home/postgres: No such file or directory
        postmaster: could not access directory "/var/lib/pgsql/13/data": Permission denied


Location of Postgres logs: :ref:`Postgres Logs <postgres-logs-locations>`.

The issue affects both standalone and high availability types of Alation instances where the installation followed a custom path and the Postgres component had been installed in a Docker container or where the ``/etc/passwd`` file had been modified.

Root Cause
-----------------

This is a bug. Starting with 2023.3.1, the UID of the ``postgres`` user was changed, which causes misalignment with the ``postgresql`` user/group on existing instances that are being upgraded.

A fix will be provided in a future Alation version.

Solution
-----------------

If the upgrade fails on your instance due to this issue, perform the following steps on the Alation server **after the upgrade fails**.

    .. important::

        In case of the high availability pair, perform these steps on both primary and secondary servers.

1. On the Alation server, from the Alation shell, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        chown -R postgres:postgres /data1/psql /data2/backup/pgbackrest/

2. Restart Alation.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        service alation restart

3. Re-attempt the upgrade.
