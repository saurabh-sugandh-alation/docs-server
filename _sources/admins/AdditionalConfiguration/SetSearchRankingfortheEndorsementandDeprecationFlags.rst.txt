Alation Search incorporates endorsement and deprecation flags into search ranking. The extent of boost or penalty is controlled with the following flags in the alation_conf:

.. code-block:: Bash

        alation.search.flag_boost_ranking_factor
        alation.search.flag_penalty_ranking_factor

The default value for the alation.search.flag_boost_ranking_factor is 2 and the default value for the alation.search.flag_penalty_ranking_factor is 0.5.

Scores that are greater than 1.0 will boost the ranking. The higher the score, the higher the endorsed objects will appear in search ranking.
Scores that are smaller than 1.0 will penalize the ranking. The lower the score, the lower the deprecated objects will appear in search ranking.

For Alation to not analyze flags in search ranking, set the parameter(s) to 1.
