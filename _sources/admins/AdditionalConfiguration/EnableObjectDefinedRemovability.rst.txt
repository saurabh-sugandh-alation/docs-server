Enable Removability of Object-defined Fields
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from version 2023.1.4*

Alation now supports removing object-defined fields from templates and re-adding them as a part of a group of fields on the same template. Object-defined fields are read-only fields that display one or more attributes of an object on a catalog page. Examples include **Source Comments** and **Properties**.

This feature is enabled on the **Feature Configuration** page.  Toggle on the switch **Enable removability of 'Object-defined fields'**:
