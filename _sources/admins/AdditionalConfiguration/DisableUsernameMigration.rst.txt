Disable the Username Migration
===================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2021.2*

Usernames character limit is increased to 150 characters and the usernames that are truncated due to more than 30 characters will automatically get migrated. To disable the migration, set the following flag to **False** in *alation_conf*:

.. code-block:: bash

      alation.authentication.disable_username_migration -s False
