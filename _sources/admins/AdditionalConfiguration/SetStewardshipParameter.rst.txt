Set stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size Parameter
================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Curation Progress** report on the **Stewardship Dashboard** is computed
for all data objects in batches.

.. note::

    In releases before V R6 (5.10.x) the computation job is triggered when the user turns on the Stewardship Dashboard feature (using the ``alation.feature_flags.enable_stewardship_dashboard`` flag in ``alation_conf``).
    Starting from V R6, all Analytical Stewardship features are enabled by default.

The curation progress computation batch size can be regulated with
the  **stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size** parameter. The default is set to **1,000**.

Users can try decreasing  the value of the ``stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size``, parameter if
their instance is low on resources and they observe the following:

- The Analytical Stewardship Dashboard-related tasks are stuck and the system performance deteriorates
- Analytical Stewardship Dashboard tasks block or delay the progress of other tasks.

On larger instances without a limitation on resources, if you observe
the slowness  for Stewardship Dashboard-related Celery tasks, you can increase the value
of ``stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size``  parameter to
**10,000**.

To configure ``stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size`` using the ``alation_conf`` file:

#. Enter the Alation shell:

   .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

#. To view the current value of the ``stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size``, do:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alation_conf stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size

#. To set the value of ``stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size,`` run the following command substituting <value in number of tasks> with the actual value:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alation_conf stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size -s <value in number of tasks>

#. Restart the Celery component:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alation_supervisor restart celery:*
