Disable Data Exports and Downloads
==================================

*Applies from 2022.2*

In order to comply with security requirements at your company, you may need to disable certain ways of obtaining data from Alation. There are two settings for disabling data exports and downloads in Alation:

-  Disabling exports for all data sources

-  Disabling both exports and downloads for individual data sources

Disable Exports for All Data Sources
------------------------------------

Server Admins can turn off the ability to use Compose to export data. This affects all data sources and disables the **Export** button in Compose. All options normally available through this button will be unavailable, including **Run & Export Full Query**, **Run & Export Current Statement**, and **Run & Export as Script**.

To disable exports for all data sources:

.. include:: ../../shared/AdminSettings.rst

2. Under the **Server Admin** section, click **Compose Settings**.

3. Click the **Allow Query Exports** toggle to enable or disable it.

Disable Exports and Downloads for an Individual Data Source
-----------------------------------------------------------

Data Source Admins can disable both exports and downloads for individual data sources. This prevents all export and download actions for the given data source wherever such actions are available in Alation. The following options will be disabled or removed:

-  The **Export** button in Compose

-  The **Download Excel Live Reports** option under the **Share** button in Compose

-  The **Download** button on the **Results** tab in Compose

-  The **Export** button that appears above tables on execution result pages, query form pages, and table catalog pages

-  The **Download Result Table** link on execution session pages

To disable exports and downloads for a single data source:

1. Select the **Apps** menu in the top right of the toolbar.

2. Select **Sources**.

3. Select the data source you want to modify.

4. In the data source menu in the top right corner, select **More**.

5. Select **Settings**.

6. If thereâ€™s a **Compose** tab, select it. If not, select the **General Settings** tab.

7. Scroll down to the **Allow Export and Download** toggle and enable or disable it as desired.

Combining Both Options for Disabling Exports and Downloads
----------------------------------------------------------

If you disable exports with one setting but enable them with another, exports will remain *disabled* (for the data sources affected by the disabled setting). The following table goes into more detail about all the combinations.
