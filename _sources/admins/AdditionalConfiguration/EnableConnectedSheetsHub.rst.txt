Enable Connected Sheets Hub
============================

The Alation Connected Sheets Hub gives you a central location to view and manage the Connected Sheets that are shared in your organization.

Alation Connected Sheets Hub is disabled by default. Server Admins can enable or disable the feature at any time using the switch **Connected Sheets Hub Page** on the :doc:`Feature Configuration tab in Admin Settings <../../admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>`. Toggle the switch to the on-position to enable the hub:
