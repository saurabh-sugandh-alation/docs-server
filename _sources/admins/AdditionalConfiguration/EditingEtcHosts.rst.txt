Editing /etc/hosts
==================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

You may need to edit ``/etc/hosts`` in the Alation chroot to add DNS records on the Alation server.

Every time you enter the Alation shell, Alation copies the ``/etc/hosts`` file from the host system into the Alation chroot. Because of this, you shouldn't edit ``/etc/hosts`` in the Alation chroot. If you do, your changes will be overridden next time you enter the Alation shell.

.. note::

   ``/etc/hosts`` isn't managed by **alation_conf**.

To edit ``/etc/hosts``, follow these steps:

#. Use SSH to connect to the Alation server.
#. Edit ``/etc/hosts`` on the host system. Save your changes.
#. Enter the Alation shell using the following command:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

   This will automatically copy ``/etc/hosts`` to the Alation chroot.
#. Exit the Alation shell.

   .. code-block:: Bash

      exit
