Enable Custom Field Search
===========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2023.3*

By default, Alation Search allows you to filter searches by the various fields associated with an object type. Instead of trying to remember the appropriate filters, you can enable custom field search that allows custom field values to be added to the search index. You can then search more naturally for the values you are interested in. 

Alation Cloud Service customers can raise a support ticket to have custom field search enabled in their instances.

.. note::

    If custom field search is enabled, your users will be able to search for all custom fields, including those that may have been hidden from them using :doc:`Custom Field Permissions </steward/DataCatalogCustomization/CustomFieldPermissions>`. If you have set such permissions, we recommend that you not enable custom field search.


You enable custom field search by setting the feature flag ``alation.search.enable_custom_field_search`` to ``True`` with **alation_conf** as follows:

.. include:: ../../shared/AccessingAlationShell.rst

#. Call **alation_conf** to set the feature flag:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_conf alation.search.enable_custom_field_search -s True


You disable custom field search by setting the feature flag ``alation.search.enable_custom_field_search`` to ``False`` with **alation_conf** as follows:

.. include:: ../../shared/AccessingAlationShell.rst

#. Call **alation_conf** to set the feature flag:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_conf alation.search.enable_custom_field_search -s False
