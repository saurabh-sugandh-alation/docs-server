Configure Access to the Internal Help Desk
==============================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies to 5.9.13, 5.10.9, 5.12.7 and later releases*

You can optionally add one more link to Alation that allows users to access your internal help desk. This is useful if you set up a process for Alation users to first reach out to the internal help desk if they encounter issues with the Alation Catalog or Compose. This link is visible to all users and has no dependency on their Alation role. It is displayed in the **Information** menu in the Alation Catalog and in the **Help** menu in Compose.

.. include:: /shared/CloudMessages/CloudSupportRequest.rst

The configuration is done using the **alation_conf**:

1. SSH to your Alation instance and enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

2. Add the URL to your internal help desk as the value to the parameter `alation.help.helpdesk_url`. The URL should include the `HTTP` or `HTTPS` prefix:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        alation_conf alation.help.helpdesk_url -s <helpdesk url>

**Example**: `alation_conf alation.help.helpdesk_url -s https://helpdesk.company.com`

3. No restart is required. Refresh the Alation page to see the changes.Â
