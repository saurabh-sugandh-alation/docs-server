Manage Access to Data Export and Download
=========================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation provides the ability to export and download data from your connected data sources. To help you comply with security requirements at your organization, Alation also provides the ability to manage user access to the export and download features in Alation.

Access can be controlled in these ways:

-  Server Admins can enable and disable the ability to *export* for all data sources.

-  Data Source Admins can enable and disable the ability to both *export* and *download* for individual data sources.

   -  Starting in 2023.3.1, access to export and download for a given data source can be granted to specific users or groups.

These concepts and processes are described below.

-  `Manage Access to Export for All Data Sources`_

-  `Manage Access to Export and Download for an Individual Data Source`_

-  `Combining Both Options for Disabling Exports and Downloads`_

Export and Download Features
----------------------------

Export and download together cover several features located throughout Alation that let you save data from Alation to your computer.

Export
~~~~~~

*Export* refers to the ability to run a query and save the results directly to your local computer. This is available through the **Export** button in Compose:

It includes all export options in the Export button’s drop-down menu:

-  Run & Export Full Query

-  Run & Export Current Statement

-  Run & Export as Script

Download

Manage Access to Export for All Data Sources
--------------------------------------------

Server Admins can manage the ability to use Compose to export data for all data sources and all users. This controls the **Export** button in Compose and all options normally available through this button.

To manage the ability to export for all data sources:

.. include:: ../../shared/AdminSettings.rst

#. Under the **Server Admin** section, click **Compose Settings**.

#. Click the **Allow Query Exports** toggle to enable or disable it as desired.

Manage Access to Export and Download for an Individual Data Source
------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Source Admins can manage the ability to both export and download for individual data sources. This controls all export and download actions for the given data source wherever such actions are available in Alation. Starting in 2023.3.1, access to export and download can be granted to specific users or groups for each data source.

To manage the ability to export and download for a single data source:

1. Select the **Apps** menu in the top right of the toolbar.

2. Select **Sources**.

3. Select the data source you want to modify.

4. In the data source menu in the top right corner, select **More**, then **Settings**.

5. If there’s a **Compose** tab, select it. If not, select the **General Settings** tab.

6. Find the **Allow Export and Download** toggle and enable or disable it as desired. When enabled, all users have access to export and download by default.

7. In 2023.3.1 and later, if the toggle is enabled, you can limit access to specific users and groups if desired.

   a. Deselect the checkbox for **Everyone has export and download access**.

   b. Click the **+ Add** button.

   c. Use the search box to find the user or group you want.

   d. Select the user or group you want to grant access to export and download.

   e. Once a user or group has been added, you can click the **X** next to their name to revoke their access to export and download.

8. Click **Save**.

Combining Both Options for Disabling Exports and Downloads
----------------------------------------------------------

If you disable exports with one setting but enable them with another, exports will remain disabled (for the data sources affected by the disabled setting). The following table goes into more detail about all the combinations.
