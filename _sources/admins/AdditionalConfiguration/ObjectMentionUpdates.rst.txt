Updating Object Mentions
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

In Alation is it possible to reference the catalog objects
by *@-mentioning* them in rich text fields. 

Alation saves these references by wrapping the information on the object
into the HTMLtag <a> and embedding this tag in the field value.

Before V R5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In releases before V R5 (5.9.x), the embedded <a> tag included the
title of the referenced object. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   <a data-oid=5 data-otype="table" href="/table/5/">table.title</a>

To keep the mentioned/referenced objects up-to-date, Alation would
update these embedded tags every time the title of the object changed.
This update was propagated with two asynchronous Celery jobs for every
update being put and processed in the *default* queue of Celery
workers.

Unfortunately, Alation ran into a performance issue with this approach,
as the more references had to be updated, the larger number of
corresponding Celery jobs would have to be triggered. If a large
amount of catalog data was loaded using the public API, the number of
references to be updated would kick off so many update mentions Celery
jobs that the queue would overload and stall.

Changes in V R5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with V R5 (5.9.x), Alation stores object references differently
aiming at a more effective handling of large volumes of catalog data.
 The <a> tag now includes only the reference of the object without
storing any data about it (that is, it no longer stores the title):

.. code-block:: bash

   <a data-oid=5 data-otype="table" href="/table/5/"></a>

Instead of triggering the Celery "update mention" jobs, Alation now uses
the backend APIs to fetch the current name and title of the referenced
object whenever it is rendered in the UI. Deprecation of the "update
mention" Celery jobs in R5 allows us to keep the Celery queue healthy
and moving when a large number of object references has to be updated.
