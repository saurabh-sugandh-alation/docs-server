To enable the report:

1. In Alation, go to **Admin Settings > Feature Configuration**.
2. Locate the feature switch **Alation Analytics V2 Leaderboard - List of top ten contributors**.
3. Toggle the switch on and save the changes.

The **Built In** tab and the Top Contributors report should appear on the Alation Analytics Dashboard.
