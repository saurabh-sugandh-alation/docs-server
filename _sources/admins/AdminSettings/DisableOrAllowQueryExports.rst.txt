Allow or Disable Query Export
===================================

*Applies from release 2021.1*

It is possible to disable the Compose feature of Query Export. A Server Admin may consider disabling it when exporting data is not allowed by their Companyâ€™s data policy.


When query export is disabled:

- users executing a query will not be able to stream the complete result set into an export file;

- The **Export** menu in Compose is not available, including all its options such as **Run & Export Full Query**, **Run & Export Current Statement**, and **Run & Export as Script**

To disable query export:

1. Log in to Alation and go to **Admin Settings > Server Admin > Compose Settings** section.

2. Locate the switch **Allow Query Exports**. By default, it is enabled:

3. Click the toggle to disable query export and save the changes on the page.

To allow query export if it is disabled, click the **Allow Query Exports** toggle to turn it on and save the changes.

    .. note::

        Compose users logged in at the time this setting is changed will see the effect only after a refresh of the browser page: the **Export** menu should become disabled in the Compose UI. If they do not refresh the browser, they will still be prevented from Running & Exporting: query export will fail although the **Export** menu will be present until the browser page is refreshed.

        The same applies to enabling the feature after it was disabled: the **Export** menu will become enabled after a refresh of the browser page.
