Manage Scheduled Queries
========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from 2023.1*

Server Admins can view and manage all scheduled queries using the Scheduled Query Dashboard. The dashboard empowers Server Admins to balance system resources consumed by scheduled queries and manage "ghost" queries whose owners have left the company. From the dashboard, you can:

-  View the current schedule and other details.

-  Change the schedule.

-  Cancel the next run.

-  Disable the schedule.

-  Change the :doc:`access level </analyst/ShareAndAccessQueries/ShareAndAccessQueries2023_1/UnderstandQueryAccess>` for the query and assign a new owner.

The ability to schedule queries and use the Scheduled Queries dashboard can be enabled or disabled by a Server Admin. See :doc:`/admins/AdditionalConfiguration/EnableOrDisableQueryScheduling` for instructions.

Open the Scheduled Query Dashboard
----------------------------------

Only Server Admins have access to the Scheduled Query Dashboard. To open the Scheduled Query Dashboard:

1. Click the Settings gear icon in the top right corner of Alation. The Admin Settings page opens.

2. In the **Monitor** section, select **Scheduled Query Dashboard**.
   
   .. note::
   
      If scheduled queries have been disabled, the dashboard will not open. See :doc:`/admins/AdditionalConfiguration/EnableOrDisableQueryScheduling` for help enabling this feature.

Dashboard Overview
------------------

The Scheduled Query Dashboard contains several columns with details about all scheduled queries in Alation. The column order can be :ref:`changed <Arrange-Columns>`. You may need to scroll the dashboard to the right to see all the columns.

The columns are:

-  **Query Title**—The curated name of the query. Click the link to go to the query catalog page.

-  **Data Source**—The data source that the query will run against. Click the link to go to the data source catalog page.

-  **Owner**—The owner of the query. Click the link to go to the owner’s user profile.

-  **Owner Status**—Query owner's account status, which can be either User Suspended or User Active.

-  **Schedule**—Summary of the query’s current schedule.

-  **Next Run**—Time at which the query will next run.

-  **Status**—The current status of the query’s schedule.

   -  **Ready**—The query ran successfully on its last scheduled run, and it's ready to run at the next scheduled time.

      .. note::
      
         If you canceled the next run, the schedule status is still Ready. It will simply skip one scheduled run and execute on the next one.

   -  **Running**—The query is currently running.

   -  **Disabled**—The query’s schedule is currently disabled.

-  **(...)**—Action menu where you can `change the schedule <#change-the-schedule>`__, `cancel the next run <#cancel-the-next-run>`__, `enable or disable the schedule <#enable-or-disable-the-schedule>`__, and `change who has access <#change-query-access>`__ to the query.
