Manage Groups
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

A group is a set of members who perform similar tasks in Alation or
belong to the same department in an organization.

Alation has 2 types of groups:

    - `Built-In Groups`_
    - `Custom Groups`_

Groups can be managed by users with the *Server Admin* or *Catalog Admin* roles.

To access the **Admin Settings > Groups** page:

1. If you are a *Catalog Admin*, click the Settings menu on top right and then click **Groups**:

2. If you are a *Server Admin*, go to the **Admin Settings** page and click **Groups** in the **Catalog Admin** section:

Built-In Groups
-------------------

Built-in groups are available by default and cannot be removed. They directly correspond to the Alation roles:

    - In releases *up to V R6 (5.10.x)*: the built-in groups are *Server Admins* and *Catalog Admins*.
    - *Starting with V R7 (5.12.x)*, there are 6 built-in groups: *Server Admins*, *Catalog Admins*, *Source Admins*, *Composers*, *Stewards*, *Viewers*.

Each built-in group includes users with the respective Alation role as members. When the role of a user is changed, it is reflected in their membership in a built-in group: the user is automatically placed into the built-in group that corresponds to their new role.

Both *Server Admins* and *Catalog Admins* can view built-in groups.

From release V R7 (5.12.x), the built-in groups cannot be edited. They are updated automatically when Alation users are assigned roles.

Custom Groups
-----------------

Custom groups are either created by Server or Catalog Admins or created automatically as the result of SCIM sync.

    .. note::

        SCIM groups are available from version 2021.3

Groups that are **Defined in Alation** or **Defined in LDAP** can be created manually by admins:

      - **Custom group is defined in Alation**: when a custom group is defined in Alation, group members can be added manually from user accounts that exist in Alation.

      - **Custom group is defined in LDAP**: when a custom group is defined in LDAP, it is configured to use the DN of the corresponding group in the LDAP directory of the organization to sync the group members between Alation and the LDAP directory. LDAP groups should be configured when Alation uses the LDAP authentication method and users and groups in Alation and in the LDAP directory need to be in sync.

Groups that are **Defined in SCIM** are created automatically when SCIM integration is enabled on the Alation instance and Groups are pushed from the IdP over SCIM. SCIM integration requires that the authentication method in Alation should be SAML. Also see :doc:`SCIM Groups <../../admins/AdminSettings/SCIMGroups>`.

Create Custom Groups Defined in Alation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Log in to Alation as a Server or Catalog Admin and go to the **Groups** page in Settings.

2. On the Groups page, scroll down to the **Custom Groups** section.

3. Click the **Add Group** link on the right. A new untitled group in the Edit mode will appear under Custom Groups.

4. Click on the **Group Name** field and type a name.

5. By default, the **Defined in** field is set to *Alation*. Leave the default value.

6. *Release 2021.1 and later*: map an Alation role onto the group using the **Mapped to** list. Mapping a role onto the custom group is optional if you are using the default method of role assignment. However, it is required if you are going to enable role assignment using custom groups. This action is available to *Server Admins* only, and will appear as disabled to a *Catalog Admin*.

    .. note::

        For details on role assignment using custom groups, see :doc:`Use Custom Groups to Assign User Roles <../../admins/AdminSettings/UseCustomGroupsToAssignRoles>`.

7. Click **Save**. The custom group is created. After the group information has been saved, you can add group members.

Map Groups Onto Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Applies from release 2021.1*

The group-role mapping is optional for the default method of role assignment. By default, Server Admins assign roles on a per-user basis on the **Admin Settings > Users** page.

The group-role mapping is required when the **Use Custom Groups to assign user roles** is enabled: :doc:`Use Custom Groups to Assign User Roles <../../admins/AdminSettings/UseCustomGroupsToAssignRoles>`.

To map the group onto a role:

1. When editing a custom group, use the **Mapped to** list to map this group onto an Alation role:

    .. image:: ../../_static/CreateGroups_04.png

2. Save the changes to the group.

3. If there are already members in this group and the **Use Custom Groups to assign user roles** setting is already enabled, then Alation will update the role assignments of the group members. Refresh the page to see the changes in role assignment reflected in the built-in groups.

Delete a Custom Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To delete a Custom Group, click the **Delete** icon adjacent to the Group name.
#. Confirm the deletion of the group.
