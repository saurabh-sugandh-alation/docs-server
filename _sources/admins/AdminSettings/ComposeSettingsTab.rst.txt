Compose Settings Tab
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Compose Settings** section of the Admin Settings allows Server Admins to configure global Compose settings for:

-  Whether to use Compose Web or Compose Desktop
-  Whether to automatically connect to data sources when opening a new Compose tab
-  Whether to allow query execution deferral
-  Whether to allow query results to be exported
-  Whether to allow comments inside variables
-  Whether to trim extra spaces for fixed length char types
-  Whether to wrap fields in quotes for exports and downloads
-  How long to wait for a response to various requests (database connection, default schema, cancel, and explain)
-  How long to wait before ingesting executed statements
-  Maximum result size

The Compose Settings section provides an explanation for each setting. This tab is only visible to Server Admins.

Compose itself has separate settings that each Compose user can configure individually to fine-tune their Compose experience. To access these personal Compose settings, go to Compose, then click the **Settings** menu in the top right corner.
