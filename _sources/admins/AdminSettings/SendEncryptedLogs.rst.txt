2. This page includes instructions on how to send logs to Alation. In the date picker, select the time period for which you want to view the logs. The Logs table will update to display all the logs found at **/opt/alation/site/logs** and dated in the selected time period.
#. Select the checkboxes of the logs you want to bundle. The estimated size of all the log files you select will be summed up in the  Estimated Size field above the table.
#. Click **Prepare**. Alation will collect, encrypt, and package the selected logs.
#. Click **Download** to download the logs package to your machine.
#. Rename the downloaded file to include the name of your organization. For example: ``Organization_Name-yyyymmdd`` (where ``yyyymmdd`` stands for date).
#. Log in to `Customer Portal <https://customerportal.alationdata.com>`_ and upload the logs package by clicking **Upload Your Log Data Here**. You will see a notification that confirms that upload was completed successfully.
