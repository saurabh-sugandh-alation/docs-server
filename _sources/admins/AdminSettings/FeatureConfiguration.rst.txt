*Applies from release 2021.1*

.. note::

    In releases prior to 2021.1, the **Feature Configuration** page was known as **Labs**.

**Feature Configuration** is a section in **Admin Settings** where you can enable and disable Alation features. It is visible to users with the *Server Admin* role.

To open Feature Configuration,

1. Sign in to Alation as a *Server Admin* and click the **Admin Settings** icon on the upper right to open the Admin Settings page:

Some features cannot be disabled. This will be indicated in the feature description next to the feature toggle. For example:

    .. image:: ../../_static/Labs_05.png
        :width: 450px

After you have enabled such a feature, the toggle will become inactive eliminating the ability to turn the feature off:
