Manage Glossary and Term Configuration
=======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Four flags on the :doc:`Feature Configuration page </admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>` control the behavior of the Glossary and Terms functionality introduced in Alation 2022.2:

- **Glossary Terms Setup:** This flag turns on the Glossary and Terms functionality and enables the user interface features that allow Server Admins and Catalog Admins to define term templates, glossaries, and terms. No changes are visible to other users. This flag is disabled by default, but can be toggled by a Server Admin on the **Feature Configuration** tab of the **Admin Settings** page. 

- **Glossary Terms GA:** This flag should be turned on once you have defined your initial set of terms and glossaries. Once this flag is enabled, Stewards and other users with appropriate permissions can define terms and glossaries, and any previous glossaries you may have created using articles to define terms are relabeled :doc:`article groups </steward/ArticleGroups/index>`. This flag is disabled by default, but can be toggled by a Server Admin on the **Feature Configuration** tab of the **Admin Settings** page.

- **Glossary Terms Performance Improvement:** This flag, when enabled, provides substantial performance improvement when listing terms. The flag, disabled by default, was introduced in Alation 2023.3.1. From Alation 2023.3.3, it is enabled by default. 

- **Glossary Terms Total Count:** This enables the **Terms** count on the **Glossary Hub**. If you have thousands of terms, we recommend that you leave this flag disabled as it can significantly increase load times.
