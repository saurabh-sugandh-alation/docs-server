Disable Public Sharing of Query Results in Compose
======================================================

*Applies from release 2021.3*

A *Server Admin* can disable **Public Sharing** of query results in Compose. By default, Public Sharing is enabled.
Compose users can share query results using the Query Results actions: **More > Share**:

Sharing can be done in either the **Public** or the **Private** mode. When Compose users click on the **Share** option for a query result, they can select a sharing option:

To disable the Public option:

1. Log in to Alation and go to **Admin Settings** > **Server Admin** > **Compose Settings**.

2. On the **Compose Settings** tab, turn off the toggle **Allow Public Sharing Of Compose Results** and save the changes:

This change results in disabling the **Public** option in the **Results Sharing** dialog in Compose. It can no longer be selected:

Note that the **Private** sharing option remains available.
