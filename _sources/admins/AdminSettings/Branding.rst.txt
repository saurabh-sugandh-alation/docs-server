===========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

You can add your company’s logo and brand color to Alation to make the Alation experience feel more like your company. Your logo will appear on the login screen and the top left corner of Alation pages, including homepages that are configured to use a small search banner. Your brand color will be used for icons and tab titles throughout the catalog. It also affects the search banner’s background on homepages where the search banner is configured to use the theme color.

.. note::

   In versions 2020.3 to 2022.2, brand color was part of customizing the homepage. See **Customizing the Homepage - 2020.3 to 2022.2** for details.

1. *Catalog Admins:* Click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner. A dropdown menu appears. Click **Branding**.
