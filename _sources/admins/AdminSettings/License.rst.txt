License
===========

Users with the *Server Admin* role can view the license consumption information on the **License** tab of the Admin Settings page. Alation has three levels of user license, which map to user roles as follows:

- **Creator License:** For all three admin roles (Server, Catalog, and Data Source), Stewards, and Composers.
- **Explorer License:** For those having the Explorer role, who need to run query forms or work in spreadsheets directly using Alation Connected Sheets. The Explorer license is available from Alation version 2023.1 on Alation Cloud Service deployments on cloud-native architecture.
- **Viewer License:** For those who use the catalog for information only.

The **License** dashboard under **Admin Settings** displays detailed license consumption information for your catalog instance:

From Alation release 2023.3, new customers on Alation's cloud-native architecture will see a different license dashboard:

The new dashboard provides greater transparency into the number of licenses of each type (Creator, Explorer, and Viewer) that are currently used and are currently available. For Creator licenses, you can click **Creator license allocation by role** to see how the licenses are allocated to the roles Composer, Steward, Source Admin, Catalog Admin, and Server Admin:

The dashboard also provides information on the usage of data objects, which can also be broken out by object type:

For customers who began using Alation's cloud-native architecture before version 2023.3, this new dashboard is hidden behind a feature flag. Contact your account manager if you want to have your account upgraded to the new entitlement service.

License Term & Expiration
----------------------------

- **Days Used** counter: visualizes the number of days the license is in use and the number of days left until its expiration date. The Alation license file has such internal property as **Date Issued**. This is the date from which Alation counts the Days Used metric.
- License details, such as **Expiration Date**, **License Name**, and **Site ID**.

User Role Assignments
-----------------------

- **Users** current number of active users on the instance.

- **Admins**, **Composers**, **Stewards**, **Explorers**, and **Viewers** counters display the number of each type of seat that is allocated, consumed, or still free. The labels you see on these counters will indicate if the limit on the seats of each type is reached:

      - **N allocated** number of seats provided under this license
      - **N left** remaining number of seats
      - **Limit Reached** all seats of this type are assigned to users, including the additional grace seats

.. note::

    The Alation license may include a certain grace number of seats of each type. When all available seats, including the grace seats,  are assigned, the counter will indicate that the license limit is reached by displaying the **Limit Reached** indicator. Until then, you may see the indicator **0 left**. **0 left** means that although the soft limit of seats purchased is reached, there are some grace seats still available.
