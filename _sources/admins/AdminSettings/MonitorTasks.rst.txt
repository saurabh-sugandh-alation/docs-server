Monitor Tasks
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from Alation V R3 (5.6.x)*

Alation provides ability for Server Admins to monitor the background
tasks being processed by the backend server - directly in UI without
referring to database tables or logs.

Tasks are granular functions executed by the Alation backend server.
Jobs - series of functions - such as Data Profiling or Metadata
Extraction, may execute one or more tasks. There are multiple queues of
tasks on the server, and each queue can be processed by one or more
workers. Occasionally, tasks may run for an excessive period of time
consuming resources and causing other tasks to get stuck in the queue
without moving into processing. Alation Admins can step in and resolve
this situation by informing themselves on the status of existing tasks
and terminating stuck tasks in the **Monitor** section of the **Admin
Settings**.

.. note::

    Task termination is part of advanced administrative functionality
    that should be used sparingly and only if a long-running task
    causes problems. Terminating tasks manually is a short-term solution in a
    situation when there may be an underlying problem with task processing.

**Monitor** provides both details on task properties and a capability
to revoke overlong tasks so that other tasks can move from the queued
state into processing.

To manage tasks,

#. Go to Admin Settings.
#. Find the **Monitor** section (on the right):

      - To view details about active tasks, click **Active Tasks**.
      - To view completed and canceled tasks, click **Completed Tasks**. The task list will open with all available information on the selected task category.

Manage Active Tasks
----------------------

Viewing Active and Upcoming Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Active and upcoming tasks can be viewed in the **Active Tasks** section of the **Monitor**:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5cm}|p{10cm}|

=================================== ======================================
Task Property                       Description
=================================== ======================================
Task Name                           The name of the task (tasks are
                                    named as the corresponding
                                    internal function)

Status                              **Active** Tasks that are
                                    currently being processed by
                                    workers.

                                    **Queued** Tasks that are
                                    still waiting in the queue.  

                                    **Scheduled**  - Tasks that are
                                    scheduled by the system to run at
                                    a specific time and have an
                                    estimated time of arrival. Note
                                    that this is backend server’s
                                    internal scheduling mechanism
                                    that is different  from the
                                    scheduling of such data source
                                    jobs as Metadata Extraction, Data
                                    Profiling, and Query Log
                                    Ingestion. These jobs are
                                    scheduled by Admins in Alation,
                                    but their respective tasks will
                                    be added to the queue with the
                                    status **Queued**.

Num Tasks                           The number of tasks with the same
                                    name. Tasks with identical names
                                    can be differentiated by their
                                    ID. If Num Tasks is greater
                                    than one, the corresponding table
                                    row will have the Full
                                    List button.

                                    To display particular Task IDs,
                                    click **Full List**.

Queue                               The name of the queue that holds
                                    a particular task. Knowing the
                                    name of the queue can be useful
                                    for finding logs on that task.

                                    For example, if the queue name of
                                    the task is **FastQueue**,
                                    then logs on this task will be in
                                    the FastQueue log
                                    file:
                                    **celery-fastqueue_error.log**.

Start Time                          Time the task began processing
=================================== ======================================

Terminating a Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To terminate a single task, click **Terminate**. To terminate one of
the tasks with the same name,  click **Full List**, choose the
specific task by its ID, and click Terminate for that task. Only
the tasks running for an excessive period of time should be terminated.

.. image:: ../../_static/MonitorActiveTasks.png
    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

Termination will stop the task and enable queued tasks to run if they
were delayed in the queue.

Terminated tasks will be moved to the **Completed Tasks** section of
the Monitor and will appear in the **Completed and Canceled
Tasks** table with the status **Canceled**.


Terminating a Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you terminate a task successfully, the corresponding job
will be terminated as well. Major jobs and their respective tasks in
Alation are:

=================== ===========================
Job                 Corresponding Task Name
=================== ===========================
Data Profiling      profile_tables
Metadata Extraction adbc_extract_metadata
Query Log Ingestion import_query_log
=================== ===========================

These jobs can be viewed in the **Job History** section of their
respective tabs on the Data Source Settings page. If you need to
stop a stuck or overlong job, you can terminate the corresponding active
task.


Example
~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you are running a Metadata Extraction (MDE) job on a Data
Source and notice that it is taking longer than usual and blocking
other tasks. To stop the job, you can terminate the
corresponding ``adbc_extract_metadata`` task. After terminating the
task, you will see that the MDE Job History table is updated to
show that a specific MDE job is stopped and has now the
status ``FAILED``.


View Completed Tasks
---------------------------

Completed and terminated tasks can be viewed in the **Completed Tasks** section of the **Monitor**:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5cm}|p{10cm}|

=================================== ======================================
Task Property                       Description
=================================== ======================================
Task Name                           The name of the task (tasks are
                                    named as the corresponding
                                    internal function)

Queue                               The name of the queue that holds
                                    a particular task. Knowing the
                                    name of the queue can be useful
                                    for finding logs on that task.
                                    For example, if the queue name of
                                    the task is ``FastQueue``,
                                    then logs on this task will be in
                                    the FastQueue log
                                    file:
                                    **celery-fastqueue_error.log**

Status                              **Completed** Tasks that are
                                    completed successfully.

                                    **Canceled** Tasks that are
                                    terminated by the user.

Queued Time                         Time the task was queued

Start Time                          Time the task began processing

Finished Time                       Time the task finished processing
=================================== ======================================

Find Out Task ID
----------------------

To find out the Task ID and its full name, mouse over the name of the
specific task in the **Active and Upcoming Tasks** table
or **Completed and Canceled Tasks** table. The **Task
Details** info box having these details will appear.

.. image:: ../../_static/MonitorTaskDetails.png

Refresh the Task List
--------------------------

To view the latest state of the tasks, mouse over the table
title **Active and Upcoming Tasks** on the **Active Tasks** tab
or **Completed and Canceled Tasks** on the **Completed Tasks** tab
to reveal the **Refresh** button on the right. Click it to refresh the
table and update its content.

Identify a Problem Task
----------------------------

Most tasks are processed fast except for the major ones produced by
the Metadata Extraction, Data Profiling, and Query Log Ingestion jobs.
It is not recommended to terminate tasks unless you suspect or know
there is a problem with a particular task and it is stuck for a
long time.

To estimate how much time a task usually takes to complete,

#. Refer to the **Completed and Canceled Tasks** table on the **Completed Tasks** tab of the Monitor.
#. Estimate the average of **Finish time - Start time** to get an understanding of the normal task processing time before you conclude that a task is taking longer than usual and terminate it.

To understand the typical queue times, estimate the time difference
between the time when the job was queued and when it ran by
estimating the average of **Start time - Queued** time for all
tasks. The normal time in queue varies based on the number of Celery
workers and the number of concurrent jobs.

Tips on Log Collection
----------------------

Logs on every task can be obtained from the Celery queue logs. To find
logs of a specific task, check the Celery log for the queue name of that
task. For example, if the queue name of the task is **FastQueue**,
then go to **/opt/alation/logs/** directory and check
the **celery-fastqueue_error.log** file to find information on the
task in question.
