Alation APIs
=======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation provides a library of RESTful APIs to enable programmatic interaction with the Alation catalog. You can learn about the APIs by going to Alation's `Developer Portal <https://developer.alation.com/dev/>`_, where we provide recipes, guides, and comprehensive reference documentation.

You can also interact with your APIs from your Alation catalog URL using the built-in Swagger integration. See the `Open API Index <https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/open-api-index>`_ for a list of which APIs can be used via Swagger.
