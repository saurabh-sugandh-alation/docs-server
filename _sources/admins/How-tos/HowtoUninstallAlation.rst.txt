How to Uninstall Alation
==========================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

This process is to be followed to completely uninstall Alation.

.. important::

      Doing anything described below will result in permanent loss of catalog data.

**All these commands are to be run as "root" or SUDO, outside of Alation shell**.

Prerequisite
---------------

Before you uninstall, take note of the paths to your data and backup files. They are needed for one of the commands you will issue as part of the uninstall. The disks mounted on **/opt/alation/alation-XXXX/data1** and **/opt/alation/alation-XXXX/data2** are your data and backup disks (**XXXX** stands for your Alation version, for example: **alation-5.10.1.89638**).

You can run the following command to find out the paths:

.. code-block:: Bash

    tail /opt/alation/alation/.disk*

To uninstall,

1. Stop Alation:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        /etc/init.d/alation stop

2. Verify that everything is unmounted from chroot:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        mount | grep alation

3. If anything is still mounted, unmount any remaining stubborn mounts (**XXXX** stands for the Alation version):

    .. code-block:: Bash

        umount /opt/alation/alation-XXXX/data1
        umount /opt/alation/alation-XXXX/data2
        umount /opt/alation/alation-XXXX/proc
        umount /opt/alation/alation-XXXX/dev

4. Verify that everything is unmounted from Chroot:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        mount | grep alation

5. Unistall Alation. On RHEL/CENTOS, do graceful uninstall first, and only if it fails, perform ungraceful uninstall.

  **RHEL/CENTOS RPM graceful uninstall**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rpm -qa | grep alation
        rpm -e alation-XXXX

  **RPM ungraceful uninstall**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

      rpm -qa | grep alation
      rpm -e alation-XXXX --justdb

  **Remove startup**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        chkconfig alation off
        chkconfig --del alation

  **Debian/Ubuntu DEB graceful uninstall**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        dpkg -l | grep alation
        sudo apt-get --purge remove alation-XXXX

  **Remove startup**:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        update-rc.d alation disable

6. Remove the ``etc/init.d`` script:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rm -f /etc/init.d/alation

7. Remove any lingering install files:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rm -rf /usr/local/alation_legacy
        rm -rf /usr/local/alation/*
        rm -rf /opt/alation/*

8. Remove alternatives:

    - Run the following command, outside of the Alation shell, to list all the packages:

          .. code-block:: Bash

              update-alternatives --display alation

    - For each Alation package, run the following to remove (**XXXX** stands for the Alation version):

         .. code-block:: Bash

             update-alternatives --remove alation /opt/alation/alation-XXXX

    - Then run the following command again to verify there are no remaining packages:

        .. code-block:: Bash

            update-alternatives --display alation

9. Remove data.

    .. important::

          You will NOT be able to recover any data after this step is run.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rm -rf <path to data>/*
        rm -rf <path to backup>/*

Now, you have uninstalled Alation.
