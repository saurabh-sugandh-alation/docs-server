How to Set Stored User Credentials for Data Sources to Expire
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. include:: /shared/CloudMessages/CloudSupportRequest.rst

Enter the Alation shell:

.. code-block:: Bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

Change the ``alation_conf alation.db_authentication.credential_days_to_live`` parameter to the desired value, which is the number of days after which you want the credentials to expire. The default value isÂ minus one (``-1``), which turns the feature off.

.. note::

    For keytab files, there is no automated cleanup; such cleanup would be the purview of server administrators at customer sites.
