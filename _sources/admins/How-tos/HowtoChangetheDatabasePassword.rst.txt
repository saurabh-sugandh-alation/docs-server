How to Change the Database Password
=====================================================================

You can reset the Alation DB password as follows, replacing <new
password> with a password of your choosing.

Enter the Alation shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell
    sudo su alation

    psql rosemeta -c "alter user alation_db with password '<new password>'"

.. note::

    Be careful about quotes. ``'<new password>''`` is surrounded by
    single quotes: ``'<new password>'``; the SQL text is surrounded by double
    quotes as shown.

.. note::

    The username for running queries against Alation DB is ``alation_db``.
