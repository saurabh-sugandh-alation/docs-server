How to Convert Usernames
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

.. warning::

      This instruction does not work for *V R7 (5.12.x)*, *2020.3*, and *2020.4* (a known issue). If you need to update usernames in these releases, please create a ticket for Alation Support.

      From version *2021.1*, the script works as expected.

Sometimes there is a need to update usernames of particular users after you switch from built-in authentication to LDAP or SAML. This article explains how to do this using a script. 

Prerequisites
----------------------------

Create a CSV file with two columns having no headers. List old usernames in the first column and new ones in the second one.

Converting usernames
--------------------

To convert usernames,

1. Sign into the Alation shell as the administrator.

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo service alation shell

2. Change the user to ``alation``.

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo su alation

3. Change to the **/opt/alation/bin/** directory.

4. Run the following script:

    .. code-block:: bash

       alation_convert_local_account --file=PATH_TO_CSV_FILE  

Successful Completion
---------------------

The script will print updated usernames and errors if any occurred.
Admin user can review all the usernames by logging into the Alation
instance and navigating to the **Users** section of **Admin Settings**.

New usernames should not exist in the system. If a username
needs to be updated to an already existing one, do this using a
temporary username that does not exist in the system. If, for example, there is
a need to rename ``User@company.com`` to ``user@company.com`` and the latter
already exists, add the following two lines to the CSV file:

==================== ========================
``user@company.com`` ``tmp_user@company.com``
``User@company.com`` ``user@company.com``
==================== ========================

Admin user can suspend ``tmp_user@company.com`` after the script has been run.
