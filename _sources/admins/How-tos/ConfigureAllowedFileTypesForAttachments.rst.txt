How to Configure a List of Allowed File Types for Article Attachments
=======================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies from release V R7 (5.12.x)*

This procedure requires server-side access to the Alation application.

.. include:: /shared/CloudMessages/CloudSupportRequest.rst

In the ``alation_conf``, there are two parameters that can be used to whitelist or blacklist file types that users may try to upload as attachments to Article objects.

- ``alation.security.whitelisted_file_extensions`` lists the allowed file types
- ``alation.security.blacklisted_file_extensions`` lists the file types that are not permitted as attachments

File types in the whitelist are allowed as attachments to article objects in Alation. File types in the blacklist are not allowed. A user trying to upload a blacklisted file type will see a warning message in Alation.

To change the lists,

1. SSH to the Alation server.

2. To view  the current values:

    .. code-block:: bash

          sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell
          alation_conf alation.security.whitelisted_file_extensions

This will output the current parameter settings. For example:

  .. image:: ../../_static/VR7_whitelist.png
        :width: 5.5in
        :align: center

3. To add a value to the list, append your value to the list of available values and deploy the updated list. To remove a value, remove it from the list and apply the remaining list. Note that there should be no spaces between values:

.. code-block:: bash

      alation_conf alation.security.whitelisted_file_extensions -s ['pdf','jpeg',
      'jpg','png','pptx','docx','xls','xml','ppt','gif','xlsx','bmp','doc','rtf',
      'gz','zip','mp4','mp3','wmv','tiff']


Changes will be applied without a restart.
