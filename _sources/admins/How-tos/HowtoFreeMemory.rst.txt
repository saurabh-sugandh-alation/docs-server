How to Free Memory

Alation jobs require a certain amount of space to complete. If that
space becomes constrained, the jobs fail to complete. When a job fails
due to lack of space, Alation reports that the job failed due to space
constraints.

Freeing Up Space on Alation
---------------------------

The process for freeing up space when Alation jobs fail involvesÂ two
main steps:

-  Freeing up space in the directories
-  Running the QLI Event Archiver from the UI to archive processed QLI data

Step 1: Free Up Space in Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To free up space for Alation jobs to run:

#. Check for available space in the root and home directories.

   .. code-block:: Bash

      df -h

#. Delete any lingering installer files if they are crowding the root or home directories.
#. Uninstall older versions of Alation if you are running successfully on the current version:

   .. code-block:: Bash

        update-alternatives --display alation
        # Remove the ones that aren't current
        rpm -e alation-1.2.3.44444
        alternatives --remove alation /opt/alation/alation-1.2.3.44444

#. Enter the Alation shell:

   .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

#. Go to the 'logs' directory:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      cd /opt/alation/site/logs

#. Delete the older log files.
#. If backups are not configured to be stored on a separate drive, check for older backups that can be deleted.

   - Remove Dump files: Go to **/opt/alation/site/dumps** and empty the directory.
   - Remove old backup files: Go to **/data2/backup** and delete any old backup files you do not need.

#. Go to the **/opt/alation/site/tmp** directory.
#. Delete the following directories:

   - **/extract_cache**
   - **/query_ingestion_buffer**
   - **/log_reporting**


Step 2: Archive Processed QLI Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Alation UI > **Admin Settings** > **Misc** tab > **Archive processed QLI data** section, run the Event Archiver with the appropriate settings:
