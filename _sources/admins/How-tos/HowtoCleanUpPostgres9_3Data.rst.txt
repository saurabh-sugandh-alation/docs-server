How to Clean up Postgres 9.3 Data
=================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

This section applies to Alation instances that were continuously updated from versions before V R5 (5.10.x) to newer versions and where the internal Postgres database (*Rosemeta*) was upgraded from version 9.3 to version 9.6.

    .. note::

        This section does not apply to instances where the initial installation was done on version V R6 (5.12.x) or newer.

Postgres 9.3 data still exists on instances updated from V R5 (5.10.x). It is possible to remove the legacy Postgres 9.3 data from the instance and free disk space.

    .. important::

        Delete the Postgres 9.3 data only after at least 90 days have passed from the moment when the internal Postgres database was upgraded from 9.3 to 9.6. This period is required for the data migration between the old and newer versions of Postgres to be fully complete.

Prerequisites
------------------

Check if the Legacy 9.3 Postgres Data Exists on the Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the root user, check if the directory **/data1/pgsql/9.3/data/** exists on the instance:

1. SSH to the Alation host and enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

2. Change user to ``root``:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo su

3. Go to **/data1/pgsql/9.3/data/** and list the contents:

    .. code-block:: console

        cd /data1/pgsql/9.3/data/
        # List the contents
        ls

|

    The **/data1/pgsql/9.3/data/** directory contains the legacy Postgres 9.3 data.

4. Exit out of the root user:

    .. code-block:: console

        exit


Verify the Active Postgres Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. important::

          Only delete the Postgres 9.3 data if the current active Postgres version on the instance is 9.6.

To verify the active Postgres version from the Alation shell with the command given below.

    .. note::

        Before running this command, make sure you have exited out of the root user back to ``alationadmin``.


    .. code-block:: console

        alation_psql

This command should return version 9.6 as the active Postgres version. Type ``\q`` to exit the Postgres shell.

Clean up Postgres 9.3 Data
-------------------------------------

To delete the 9.3 Postgres data from an Alation instance,

1. Still in the Alation shell, check if the directory and file **/data2/pg_upgrade/rosemeta/pg_upgrade_log/delete_old_cluster.sh** exist on the instance. This script should have been created after the Postgres upgrade to version 9.6.

    .. code-block:: console

        cd /data2/pg_upgrade/rosemeta/pg_upgrade_log/


2. If the script does not exist, see `Delete Postgres 9.3 Data Manually`_ below.

3. If the script exists, next, make sure that the Postgres 9.3 service is stopped:

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql-9.3 stop

|

    .. image:: ../../_static/HowtoDeletePostgres93_02.png
        :width: 400px

    If the Postgres 9.3 service does not exist on the instance, you will see the following output:

    .. image:: ../../_static/HowtoDeletePostgres93_04.png
        :width: 300px

    This also means that Postgres 9.3 is not active and its data can be removed.

4. Run the *delete_old_cluster.sh* script to delete the Postgres 9.3 data. After the script has run, the directory **/data1/pgsql/9.3/data/** should be removed.

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo ./delete_old_cluster.sh

5. Manually delete the leftover folders in the **9.3** directory to complete the clean-up:

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo rm -rf /data1/pgsql/9.3/


Delete Postgres 9.3 Data Manually
-----------------------------------

If the *delete_old_cluster.sh* script is not available on the instance, you can manually delete the Postgres 9.3 directory from the Alation Chroot. Alation did not observe any issues when it was removed manually.

To manually delete the Postgres 9.3 data,

1. From the Alation shell, make sure that the Postgres 9.3 services are stopped:

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql-9.3 stop

2. Manually remove the contents of the 9.3 directory:

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo rm -rf /data1/pgsql/9.3/
