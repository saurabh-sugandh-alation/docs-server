How to Reinitialize Alation Without Re-Install
================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

These steps can be used to reinitialize Alation without re-installing it.

.. important::

      Reinitialization results in deletion of data. This procedure is for Alation system admins only.

**Run all commands as "root" or SUDO**.

Prerequisite
-----------------

If your Alation instance is running in an HA cluster (HA configuration) and you need to reinitialize the secondary instance, make sure to first put the primary instance into standalone mode:

- Do this only on the primary node to switch it to the standalone mode

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo service alation shell
        alation_action cluster_enter_standalone_mode
        #Exit the shell
        exit

Reinitialize Alation
-----------------------

1. Stop Alation on the instance to be reinitialized. In case of HA pair configuration, stop Alation on the node to be reinitialized:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        #if not logged in as root use SUDO
        service alation stop

2. Copy a backup file to a different location in case you need to restore later:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        #optional, but skip at your own risk
        cp /opt/alation/alation/data2/backup/<backup file> /home/<directory>/<backup file>

3. Run the ``tail`` command for ``/opt/alation/alation/.disk*`` and save the output:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        # Save this output, you will need it later
        tail /opt/alation/alation/.disk*

4. Delete disk cache files:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        rm /opt/alation/alation/.disk*

5. Remove data:

    .. warning::

        There is no way to recover any data after performing this step. This step results in deleting the data existing on the instance.

    .. code-block:: Bash

        # You will not be able to recover any data after this step is run
        # Use the output you saved for paths
        rm -rf <path to data>/*
        rm -rf <path to backup>/*

6. Reinitialize Alation:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        service alation init <path to data> <path to backup>

7. If there were any custom configurations done (for example, SSL configuration), run:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        service alation shell
        alation_action deploy_conf_all

8. Start Alation:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        service alation start
