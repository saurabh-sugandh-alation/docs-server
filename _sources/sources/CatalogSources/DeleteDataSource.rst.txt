A data source can be deleted only by its *Data Source Admins*.

To delete a data source,

1. Open the catalog page of the data source you want to delete and go to its settings:

4. Click **Delete** and follow the instructions in the delete confirmation dialog.

    .. important::

        Deleting a data source is NOT a safe action and is permanent. This may
        interfere with your colleagues' work because their queries using this source will fail.
        All catalog data that is added as part of curation effort for this
        data source, such as titles, descriptions, and other field values will be
        permanently deleted.
