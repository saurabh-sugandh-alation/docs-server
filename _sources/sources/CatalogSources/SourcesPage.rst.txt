=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Sources** page in Alation is where you can add new and view
existing :doc:`sources <../../sources/CatalogSources/CatalogSourceTypes>`.

Click **Sources** on the main toolbar to open the **Sources** page:

To add a new source, you need the :doc:`Server Admin </welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>` role in Alation. For details
on adding a new source, see:

- :doc:`Add Data Sources <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/AddingaDataSource>`
- :doc:`Add a BI Server as a Source <../../bisources/AddBISources/AddingaBIServerasaSource>`
- :doc:`Add a File System <../../filesystems/FileSystems/AddingaFileSystem>`
- :doc:`Virtual Data Sources <../../sources/VirtualDataSources/index>`
- :doc:`API Resource Cataloging <../../sources/APIResources/index>`

Browse Sources
----------------

All sources added to the Alation catalog are listed under **Sources**
> **Browse Sources** tab.  The **Browse Sources** tab only displays
sources with *completed setup*.

On this tab, you can: 

1. To switch between types of sources click the type you want to view in the menu on the left:

    -  **Data Sources** (database sources and virtual data sources)
    -  **File Systems**
    -  **BI Servers**
    -  **API Resources**

2. Sort the list of available sources by **Flag**, **Name**, or **Type**. To sort, click the corresponding column name or icon.

    .. note::

        When you sort by **Flag**, you sort the sum of endorsements and deprecations on sources in the ascending or descending order. Endorsements are represented by a positive number: each endorsement gives the data object a "+1" score. Deprecations are represented by a negative number: each deprecation gives a data object is a "-1" score. For example, if a Data Source has two endorsements, its Flag value on the Sources page will be "+2". If a Data Source has two deprecations, its Flag value will be "-2". If a Data Source has two endorsements and 1 deprecation, its resulting Flag value will be "+1".

        For details on flagging data objects, see :doc:`Using Trust Flags Proceed With Confidence <../../welcome/BestPractices/UseTrustFlagstoProceedwithConfidence>`.

3. Change the number of rows displayed on the page by selecting the number from the **Show # Rows** list on the top right.

4. Find a specific source using the Filter field on the top right. In this field, start typing the name of the data source you are looking for. The list will update to match the text you are typing.

5. Star a data source to mark it as a favorite.

6. Open the dedicated catalog page of a source by clicking its title in the table:

Manage Settings
---------------

The **Manage Settings** tab of the **Sources** page provides quick access
to the source settings. It will be enabled if you are a *Server Admin* or
if you manage at least one data source as a Data Source Admin.

.. note::

    *Server Admins* can manage all Public data sources by default.

    Other users manage data sources to which they are added as *Data
    Source Admins*. For details on the function of the Data Source Admin,
    see :doc:`Access Tab <../../sources/CatalogSources/AccessTab>`. 

The content of the **Manage Settings** tab will differ depending on the
source type selected in the list on the left:

Data Sources
------------

What you see on the **Manage Settings** tab for Data Sources depends on your
data source access rights. **Manage Settings** can have 2 tables:
**Incomplete Setup** on top and **Data Source Settings** under it.

Incomplete Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table lists the data sources that have only been partially
configured. Server Admins who attempted to add these data sources to
Alation may have passed on some configuration parameters or requested
other Data Source Admins to complete setup.

Server Admins can view all partially configured data sources, but they
can only finish setup for the public ones or the ones where they
are *Data Source Admins*. Other user roles will only see incomplete sources where they are *Data Source Admins*.

To find specific Data Sources in this table, you can:

#. Sort alphanumerically by title clicking on the **Data Source** column name.
#. Use the **Filter** field: type the text you want to find in the Filter field on the top right. The list of sources will update to match the text you are typing.
#. Change the number of rows displayed on one page by using the **Show # rows** list on the top right:

Finishing Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To finish setup of a Data Source, click **Finish Setup** . The **Add Data Source** wizard will open (see :doc:`Add Data Sources <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/AddingaDataSource>` ):

Data Source Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Data Source Settings** table (below **Incomplete Setup**) displays
the status of the latest data jobs performed on data sources. *Server
Admins* see all data sources; other user roles only see
the data sources where they are *Data Source Admins*. The main data jobs
in Alation are: 

-  Metadata Extraction (MDE)
-  Data Profiling
-  Query Log Ingestion (QLI)

The data job status in the table can be:

-  Job Success
-  Partial Success
-  Job Failure
-  Not Launched
-  Running

To reveal details about a specific status, hover over this status to view the details in a popup:

    :align: center

To go to the settings page of a data source and to re-launch a job or
change the job schedule, click the **Wrench** icon for a specific data source.

For details on data source settings, see :doc:`Configuring a Data Source <../../datasources/DSConfiguration/ConfiguringaDataSource>`.

File Systems
------------

The **Browse Sources** tab for file systems has the File Systems table
with the list of file system sources added to the Alation instance:

The **Manage Settings** > **File Systems** for *Server Admins* will have the
same list of file systems plus the **Wrench** icon next to each source for quick
access to the settings:

    :align: center

For other user roles, the **Manage Settings** tab will only be enabled if they manage at least one
source. **Manage Settings** will be disabled if users do not manage any sources.

either be disabled (if they do not manage any sources) or will
have no information:

API Resources
--------------

The **Browse Sources** tab for API Resources will display the list of API Resource sources available in your Alation catalog. There are no settings for API Resource sources. This
feature is still in Beta implementation and managed using the `dedicated API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/api-resources>`_.
