A Source, a central Alation concept, is
an objectÂ that documents the connection to a data store for
users to efficiently find and understand the data they need. Sources form the backbone of your data catalog and can be viewed as a catalog representation of an actual data source.

Adding sources to your Alation catalog is the initial step for
documenting which repositories of data are available to you in your
company.

This document describes how to use the **Sources** page to add and delete sources, and to view existing sources. Your are also introduced to Metadata Extraction and Query Log Ingestion to get meaningful data about your source data.
