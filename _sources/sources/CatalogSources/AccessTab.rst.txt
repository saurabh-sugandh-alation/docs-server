Access Tab
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Access** Tab of the **Data Source** settings page allows you to manage
visibility of a data source in the Alation catalog: you can set a data
source as **Public** or **Private** and add users or groups as *Data Source
Admins* to allow them to see and manage the settings of this data source:

Data Source Privacy
-------------------

Choose an option under **Data Source Privacy**:

-  **Public** data source is visible to everyone.
-  **Private** data source is visible only to users explicitly assigned as
   *Viewers* or *Data Source Admins* and to users with the *Server Admin*
   role.

You can switch between these options when necessary and make a public
data source private and vice versa. The visibility of this data source
in the catalog will change accordingly.

Data Source Admins
------------------

To view and change the settings of a data source, you must be assigned
as a *Data Source Admin* to this source. The *Data Source Admin* function
will allow you to access the **Settings** page, assign *Viewers* and other
*Data Source Admins*, change the connection parameters, and schedule and
run data jobs, such as Metadata Extraction (MDE), Profiling, or Query
Log Ingestion (QLI).

Data Source Admins can be individual users or groups.

The :doc:`Server Admin <../../welcome/CatalogBasics/RolesOverviewVR7>` role does not
provide default access to the settings of a data source. Server Admins
can see all the data sources in the catalog, both Public and Private,
but they cannot access the settings unless they explicitly grant access
to themselves or are granted access by others.

Access for Server Admins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get admin access to a data source,

1. Sign in to Alation as a *Server Admin*.
2. Find the data source you want to be the Data Source Admin of and open its catalog page.
3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **More** then click **Settings**:

        :align: center

5. The **Access** tab will open. Under **People** > **Data Source Admins**, click **+Add** and in the quick search list that opens, find and add yourself as a Data Source Admin:

6. Refresh the page. The change will apply and the other tabs of the settings page will become active. You can now work with any settings of this data source.

Adding and Removing Data Source Admins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Source Admins can add and remove other Data Source Admins.

1. In Alation, find the data source you want to add/remove Data Source Admins to/from and open its catalog page.

2. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **More** then click **Settings**:

        :width: 3.0in
        :align: center

    .. note::

         The **Settings** link is only visible to *Data Source Admins* of a
         source or to users with the *Server Admin* role.

 3. The Access tab of the settings page will open. Under **People** > **Data Source Admins** click **+Add** and in the quick search list that opens, find and add users or groups:

    .. image:: ../../_static/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_10.59.41_AM.png
        :width: 5.5in
        :align: center

4. To remove the Data Source Admin function from a user/group, click **Remove** for this user/group in the Data Source Admins table. The permissions to access the settings will be revoked from this user/group:

        :align: center


    .. note::

        You cannot remove the last remaining *Data Source Admin* from a data
        source.

Data Source Viewers
-------------------

For users or groups of users to be able to see a *Private* data source
in the Alation catalog, they must be assigned as **Viewers** to this
data source.

.. note::

    Unlike Private data sources, Public data sources can be searched
    for and viewed by everyone.

Adding Viewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Data Source Admins* can assign
*Viewers* to a private data source.

To designate *Viewers*, on the **Access** tab of the settings, under
**People** > **Viewers & Data Source Admins**, click **+Add** on the
right and in the quick search list that opens, find and add users or
groups. By default, they are added as *Viewers*:

.. image:: ../../_static/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_1.02.19_PM.png
    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

You can switch from *Viewer* to *Data Source Admin* access and back
for individual users and groups. To do so, find these users/groups
under **Access** tab > **People** > **Viewers & Data Source Admins**
and in the **Access** Level column, select a value from the **Access
Level** list:

    :align: center

To remove any type of access from a user/group, click **Remove** for
this user/group:
