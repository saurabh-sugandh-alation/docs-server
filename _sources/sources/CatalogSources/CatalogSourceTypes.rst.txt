Types of Catalog Sources
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation supports several distinct source types. When adding a Source to your catalog you will
choose from the following list:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{7.5cm}|p{7.5cm}|

============================== ===================================================================================================
Data Source                    A source that points to a
                               database of a specific type.

                               To connect to Data Sources,
                               Alation provides built-in JDBC
                               drivers. However, you can
                               optionally use custom
                               non-built-in JDBC drivers to
                               connect.

                               If you need to connect to a
                               database type that Alation does
                               not currently support with
                               a native driver, you can add
                               your Data Source as :doc:`Custom DB <../../datasources/CustomDB/index>`.

Virtual Data Source            A source that documents a
                               database for which Alation does
                               not offer a native connector or
                               that cannot be accessed from
                               Alation because of data policy
                               restrictions or for any other
                               reasons. Metadata for virtual
                               data sources can be
                               `provided via API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/virtual-data-source>`_
                               or
                               :doc:`imported from a file <../../sources/VirtualDataSources/PopulateVirtualDataSourcefromCSVFile>`.

File System                    A source that documents data
                               stored on a file system. Use
                               the **File System** source to
                               catalog the supported file system
                               types.

BI Server                      A source that documents BI
                               servers, reports, and
                               dashboards available to analysts
                               in your organization. Connection
                               to supported BI servers and file
                               systems is established with the
                               help of Alation-developed
                               connectors and in compliance with
                               the network requirements of the
                               organization.

You can also catalog :doc:`API Resources Cataloging <../../sources/APIResources/index>`
using the `dedicated API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/api-resources>`_.  An
API resource is a type of source that catalogs API endpoints that can
be used by analysts to retrieve data at a company.

All the sources available in your catalog will be listed on the **Sources** page. 

Each source added to Alation has a dedicated catalog page that has
all the relevant *fields* with information about this source and its data.

After you have added your source to the Alation catalog, you can
run :doc:`Metadata Extraction <../../sources/CatalogSources/MetadataExtraction>`. For data sources, run *Data Profiling* to pull in metadata and data samples. To get lineage
information and an insight into which part of data is used the heaviest,
perform :doc:`Query Log Ingestion <../../sources/CatalogSources/QueryLogIngestion>`.

Connection between the data source and its underlying database allows
you to run SQL queries against this database from Compose, Alation’s querying tool.
