Metadata Extraction
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Metadata extraction (MDE) allows the metadata in an Alation data source
to stay in sync with the actual data found in the source. Metadata
extraction can be run manually or by scheduling a periodic job based on
your organization’s needs and usage.

The **Metadata Extraction** tab of the data source **Settings** page is
where you can specify schemas to include or exclude during metadata
extraction.

MDE is one of the initial steps in building out your catalog: perform
MDE after adding your data source to Alation. After running MDE for the
first time, you can schedule this process to run automatically
to keep your Alation catalog up-to-date.

For details on scheduling, see `Scheduling MDE`_.

.. note::

     MDE from large datasets may consume resources on the database.
     Alation recommends you should consult with your DBA about the best
     time to perform MDE on a specific database to minimize impact
     on its performance.

To perform MDE on your data source,

1. Open the catalog page of the data source for which you want to run MDE.
2. In the upper-right corner of the data source page, click **More...** then **Settings** to open the settings:

3. Click the **Metadata Extraction** tab to open it. If this is initial MDE, click the **Fetch from DB Now!** button to fetch the schemas from your database. This action fetches the list of available schemas:

After the schemas are fetched, you can configure `Selective Extraction`_ or extract all
schemas. Specify the schemas to extract and click **Launch Job** to
start MDE.

Selective Extraction
--------------------

Before triggering MDE, specify which schemas should be extracted and how
the next extraction should treat the previously extracted schemas which
are already in the catalog.

There are two sets of controls under Selective Extraction section:

-  Checkbox **Remove schemas from the catalog that are not captured by
   the lists below**  
-  Lists **Schemas** and **…excluding**

Remove schemas from the catalog that are not captured by the lists below
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The  **Remove schemas...** checkbox "looks back" on what is already in the
catalog. It does not affect loading metadata for the
first time, but if there are some schemas already in the catalog, you
can remove them during the next MDE if you select the **Remove schemas…**
checkbox and make sure these schemas are not present in the **Schemas** or
**...excluding** lists.

You can:

-  Select this checkbox to remove previously extracted schemas. The
   schemas to be removed should *not appear* in the **Schemas** and
   **…excluding** lists.
-  Leave this checkbox clear if you want to leave the previously
   extracted schemas in the catalog. MDE will use the **Schemas** or
   **…excluding** lists during the next extraction, but will not touch
   the schemas that have not been specified in these fields.

Schemas  and "…excluding"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Alation extracts all the schemas it can fetch from a data source.

To extract metadata selectively, use the **Schemas** and
**…excluding** fields to specify which schemas you want to extract.

The **Schemas** and **…excluding** lists are mutually exclusive: you
can either specify one or the other, but not both together. This means
you can configure selective extraction either by selecting schemas to be
included or by specifying schemas to be excluded.

Schemas
^^^^^^^^^^^

To view all the fetched schemas, click the down arrow icon next to **Schemas**. **All Schemas** info-box will open. It lists all schemas Alation fetched from the data source:

To select specific schemas, click the **Schemas** field then, from the
list that opens, select the schemas to be extracted. When you
change the **Schemas** list, the **...excluding** list will become
disabled because these lists are mutually exclusive. When you specify
schemas in the **Schemas** field, the MDE job you run based on these
settings will extract only the schemas you have specified in this list:

    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

...excluding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, in the **...excluding** list, select the schemas you do
not want to extract into the catalog. You can only change this
list if the **Schemas** list is blank because they are interchangeable. When
you specify schemas to be excluded in the **...excluding** field, the
Schemas field becomes disabled. The MDE job you run based on the
exclusion settings will extract all schemas except the ones specified in
the **...excluding list**.

To select specific schemas to be excluded, click the
**...excluding** field then select the schemas to be extracted
from the schema list:

Example
~~~~~~~

For example, the following setting will remove all the previously
extracted schemas from the catalog and will only extract the one schema
specified in Schemas :

Scheduling MDE
--------------

A scheduled automatic MDE job will extract the most up-to-date metadata
based on the schedule you define. By default, scheduled automatic
extraction is disabled.

To enable scheduled extraction, 

1. On the **Metadata Extraction** tab, find the **Automated Extraction** section.
2. Clear the **Disable automatic extraction** checkbox. This will reveal the time settings:

3. Specify the schedule for MDE using the time controls. After you have scheduled MDE, it will run automatically in the background, based on the schedule you have set.

.. note::

     Time is displayed according to the local time zone (as
     determined by your browser/operating system) but stored on the
     Alation server subject to the Daylight Savings Time policies in
     effect for most of North America (the United States, Canada, and a
     number of island nations).

     Implications:

     On the *second Sunday in March*, the server clock will be advanced by one hour.

     On the *first Sunday in November*, the server clock will be
     reverted by one hour.

Launching MDE
-------------

To manually launch MDE, click **Relaunch Job** under the **Selective
Extraction** section:

You can monitor the job status
(from *Started* to *Ingesting* to *Succeeded* (or *Failed* ) in
the Job History table. Click **Refresh** to display the most recent state.
