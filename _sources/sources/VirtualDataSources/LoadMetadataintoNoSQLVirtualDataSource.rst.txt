Loading Metadata into a NoSQL Virtual Data Source
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation does not extract metadata into virtual data sources (VDS). You will
need to upload the metadata using the dedicated API.

To upload the metadata,

#. Click the **General Settings** tab of your NoSQL VDS setting page to open it:

   .. image:: ../../_static/NoSQL2.png
        :width: 5.5in
        :align: center

#. Under **Bulk Upload API**, take note of the URL to use in the API calls. It already includes the ID of the current VDS.
#. Using your API software, create a POST request using the **Bulk Upload API URL** from Alation. If you are loading schemas in JSON, use the URL as is. If you are loading schemas in the Avro format, you need to append the parameter ``?json_type=avro`` to the URL. For example: ``https://test-master.alation-test.com/integration/v1/data/1441/parse_docstore/?json_type=avro``. Support of Avro schemas is available starting with release *V R6 (5.10.x)*.
#. To create the JSON body for your API request refer to `NOSQL API documentation <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/nosql-apis>`_.

After the upload, your VDS in Alation will show the metadata you have
pushed using the API, with each data object having a dedicated catalog
page.
