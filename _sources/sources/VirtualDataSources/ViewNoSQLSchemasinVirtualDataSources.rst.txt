Viewing NoSQL Schemas in Virtual Data Sources
=====================================================================

On how to create a NoSQL Virtual Data Sources (VDS) in Alation,
see:Â :doc:`Virtual Data Source for NoSQL Databases </sources/VirtualDataSources/VirtualDataSourceforNoSQLDatabases>`.

On how to upload schemas in JSON or Avro formats using the NoSQL API,
see `NoSQL API documentation <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/nosql-apis>`_ on
Alation's Developer Portal.

After you have uploaded your schema(s) to a NoSQL VDS, they will have
their dedicated catalog pages in Alation under this data source. The
NoSQL VDS structure has the following nested levels:

- Folder

- Collection

- Schemata

-  Data Objects (JSON) or Data Types (Avro)

Folder Level
----------------

The folder level is the top-level that appears under **Contents** on
your VDS page. You can upload one or multiple folders to your NoSQL VDS:

    :width: 4.5in
    :align: center

.. note::

     The top-level FOLDER nests one or multiple COLLECTIONS:

         :width: 30px
         :align: center

Collection Level
-------------------

Drilling down into a Folder, you will see the list of nested collections:

    :align: center

.. note::

     A COLLECTION nests schemas. If you define the schemas with JSON,
     Alation will display the metadata as a structure of data objects.

     If you define your metadata using the Avro format, schemas will be
     represented as a structure of Avro data types.

Schema Level
--------------

Drill into a Collection to open the list of uploaded Schemas:

    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

.. note::

     A Schema is the SCHEMATA level of the metadata you are loading using the
     NoSQL API. This is the property that hosts the data objects or Avro
     data types of your metadata.

Complex data types are expandable and include nested data types on lower levels:

    :width: 5.5in

You can drill down into each Schema to view nested data objects or data
types.
