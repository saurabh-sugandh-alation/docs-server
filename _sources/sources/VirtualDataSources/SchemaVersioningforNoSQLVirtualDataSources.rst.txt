Schema Versioning for NoSQL Virtual Data Sources
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from release V R6 (5.10.x)*

What is NoSQL Schema Versioning?
--------------------------------

The metadata you load into a **Generic NoSQL virtual data source** (VDS) can
be versioned to track changes to the data objects or data types.

We recommend that you enable schema versioning for a VDS that you know
will have metadata in Avro format. Version history will reflect
changes to data types in the uploaded Avro schemas.

Turn on schema versioning right after you create a NoSQL VDS but before
you upload the metadata for the first time. This way, the first schema
upload will become Version 1 of the metadata and all subsequent changes
will be calculated off this first version.

.. note::

    Calculating changes for the schema version history make take time and
    slow down the NoSQL API when you use it to update your data source.
    Enable this feature only if version history is a must-have for
    your NoSQL VDS (when you are loading schemas in Avro format).

Â Enabling Schema Versioning
---------------------------

Schema versioning can be enabled for each specific VDS of Generic NoSQL
type that you create in Alation. By default, it is turned off.

To enable schema versioning,

#. On the catalog page of the NoSQL VDS, on the upper right, click **Settings** to open the data source settings page:

      :align: center

2. Click the **General Settings** tab and turn on the switch **Enable Versioning for the Data Source**. This enables schema versioning for this VDS. When it is enabled, you will see the **Version History** link for the uploaded schemas.

  .. important::

      After being enabled, schema versioning cannot be disabled.

Viewing Change History for a Schema
-----------------------------------

To open the change history for a schema, click the **Version History** link
on the catalog page of the schema:

.. image:: ../../_static/NoSQL_History2.png
    :width: 5.5in
    :align: center

Version History will show:

-  Schema versions

   -  A version is an object that is created in the catalog after
      each API call that loads new and updates existing metadata to this
      data source. A version for a specific Avro schema is created only
      if this schema is affected by the API call.

-  Changes in the newer version as compared to one previous version

   -  Type created
   -  Type updated
   -  Deleted

.. note::

    The **Other Metadata** field history is not captured. Version
    History only reflects changes to the data types and properties
    required by the API. See :doc:`Supported Avro Data Types <../../sources/VirtualDataSources/AvroDataTypesSupport>`.

Filtering the List of Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the list of changes in the Version History using the
quick filter on top of the table.

You can also sort the list of changes by Version.
