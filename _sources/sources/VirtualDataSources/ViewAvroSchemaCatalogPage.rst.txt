Viewing the Avro Schema Catalog Page
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

When you navigate to the dedicated page of a NoSQL schema, it will show
all the data objects or data types  loaded for this schema
under the Schema field:

-  **Key** data type name property
-  **Type** data type definition
-  **Title** the title property, if applicable
-  **Description** the description property, if applicable

On this page, you can also view the **Version History** for the

Other Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Avro schema page includes the **Other Metadata** field. This field
will list any Avro data type properties that are not included in the
Alation’s logical model for Avro format and are not required by the
NoSQL API but were loaded in addition to the required properties.

.. note::

 The Alation model uses the properties **name**, **data type**, **title**, and
 **description** to build the Schema table on the catalog page of a
 schema. If any other properties were loaded for the data types in     
 this schema, they will appear under **Other Metadata**.
