Configure Compose for OCF Data Sources
==========================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

To configure Compose with your OCF data source, go to the **Compose** tab on the Settings page of your OCF data source.

View the Driver
-----------------

The drivers for OCF data sources are compiled with the OCF connectors. To view the information about drivers, go to the **Driver** section of the **Compose** tab.

Configure Compose
--------------------

Following are the steps involved in configuring Compose:

    1. `Enable Export and Download of Query Results`_ 

    2. `Preserve Query Results`_

    3. `Enable Data Source in Compose`_
    
    4. `Select a Data Uploader`_

    5. `Share Query Results`_


Enable Export and Download of Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable or disable exporting and downloading of Compose query results for your xxxflake OCF connector. 

    1. Go to the Settings page of your OCF data sourcer, and enable or disable **Allow Export and Download** toggle on the **Compose** tab.

    2. Disable the **Exporting and downloading** toggle. This option is enabled by default. 


    .. note::
        
        There is also a global setting that controls the ability to download. See :doc:`/admins/AdditionalConfiguration/ManageAccessToDataExportAndDownload` for more details about using these various settings and how they interact with each other.

If you enable exporting and downloading of queries, you can control the access to the downloaded query. Select **Everyone has export and download access** under **Who Has Access** section to allow everyone to export and download. Otherwise, click the **Add+** button to provide access to required users and groups.

Preserve Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation allows you to preserve query results permanently so they aren’t deleted. 

To preserve query results permanently until you delete them explicitly, go to the Settings page of your OCF data sourcer and enable or disable the **Preserve Query Results** toggle.


Enable Data Source in Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, a data source is not enabled for use in Compose. To allow Compose for a data source:

1. Click the **Enabled in Compose** toggle to activate it. This will reveal the **Compose Connections** information.

2. Edit the default connection or add a new connection:

    - To edit the default Compose connection, click the pencil icon for the **Default Connection** row of the **Compose Connections** table. In the **Edit Connection** dialog that opens, update the URL field as necessary. Click **OK** in the dialog to save your changes.

    - To create a new connection for Compose, click **+Add** to the right of the **Compose Connections** section title. In the **Add Connection** dialog that opens, specify a Title (name) for your connection and a URL. Click **Add** in the dialog to save your changes.


The connections created on this page appear in the **Connection Settings** dialog in Compose and are visible to users:

    - In Compose, they can be selected to establish a data source connection for querying.

    - In the catalog, they can be selected when running query forms, uploading data, and performing dynamic sampling.

Find more information in :doc:`/analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/WorkingWithDataSourceConnections` and :ref:`ocf-dynamic-sampling`.

    .. note::

        Users are not required to select an existing connection, as they can create their own connections via the **Connection Settings** dialog.


Share Compose Connection 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select one of the Compose Connection Sharing options:

    - **Shared connections across tabs**—This option lets users use the same connection across multiple Compose tabs.
    - **Separate connection per tab**—Users can use different connections for each Compose tab, which enables them to run multiple queries at the same time.

Enable User Impersonation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Enable User Impersonation** setting is available on the **Compose** tab if your data source supports it. To connect to the data source with the impersonation account, enable the **Enable User Impersonation** option. You can execute all Compose queries against the database as queries from one impersonated user.

After enabling user impersonation, specify the username and password for the impersonation account. If applicable, enable the **Enable Kerberos Authentication** toggle and upload the appropriate keytab.

Select a Data Uploader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select a Data Uploader option based on the description below:

    - **Use Global Setting (true)** or **Use Global Setting (false)**—Use the global setting option.

        .. note::

            The global setting is configured on the backend of the Alation server in the **alation_conf** parameter ``alation.data_uploader.enabled``. Users are allowed to upload data to data sources if this flag is set to ``True``; or if the flag is set to ``False``, users are not allowed to upload data into any data source.

    - **Enable for this data source**—Use this option to enable the data upload for this data source and override the global setting if the global setting is set to ``False``.
    
    - **Disable for this data source**—Use this option to disable the data upload for this data source and override the global setting if it is set to ``True``.

Share Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alation allows you to change the Query Result Sharing Permission.

Go to the Settings page of your OCF data source, and select one of the following options under the **Share Query Results** section of the **Compose** tab:

    - **No Sharing Allowed** - Select this option to disable the result sharing.

    - **Allow Private Sharing Of Compose Results only** - Select this option to enable only private sharing of query results and disable public result sharing.

    - **Allow Private and Public Sharing Of Compose Results** - Select this option to enable private and public result sharing.
