Manage Connectors
======================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

The **Manage Connectors**  page displays the list of OCF Connectors installed on the Alation server. The **Connectors Dashboard**  is a one stop place for Server Admin users to install and manage OCF Connectors. This page can be accessed from **Admin Settings > Server Admin > Manage Connectors**.

Users can find the following information on the Connectors Dashboard:

  -  Connector Name
  -  Description of the connector
  -  Status
  -  Connector Version
  -  Last Updated

This information is retrieved from the corresponding Connector container and manifest file.

Install an OCF Connector
----------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install an OCF Connector from the OCF Connector Dashboard the following requirements must be met:

    - Make sure that Alation Connector Manager is installed. For information about installing Alation Connector Manager, refer to :doc:`Install Alation Connector Manager <../../sources/OpenConnectorFramework/OCFInstallAlationConnectorManager>`.
    - Make sure you have the OCF Connector Zip file on your machine.
    - For installing BI Connectors, make sure that the below two *alation_conf* parameters are set to true:

      .. code-block:: Bash

          alation.feature_flags.enable_gbm_v2_connector_strategy
          alation.feature_flags.enable_lineage_v2


Install an OCF Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actions

.. include:: ../../shared/ConnectorActions.rst

Logs
----------

The log information for connectors is available in the OCF Admin Dashboard. Click a **Connector Name** to view the logs for this connector.

The default view is **Connector Logs**. You can switch between **Connector Logs** and **System Logs**. Connector Logs are retrieved  from the **connector.log** file, and System Logs are retrieved from the **ocf.log** file. Both log files are stored in the **/opt/alation/site/logs** folder on the Alation server (path inside the Alation shell). The Logs area displays 7 days or 1,000 lines of logs.

The logs can be downloaded from the OCF Admin Dashboard and they are encrypted. Send the logs to Alation support for the resolution of the issue.

Troubleshooting
----------------------

Unknown Connector Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the **Manage Connectors** dashboard, you may see one or more connectors with the status *Unknown*. The status Unknown appears for connectors if  the Connector Manager is unreachable by the Alation server.

For connectors with the *Unknown* status, the lifecycle operations will not work from the Manage Connectors dashboard.

To troubleshoot the Unknown status for a connector, make sure that the Connector Manager is properly set up and can be reached by Alation:

    - On the Alation server, run an *alation_ypireti* command to make sure the Alation frontend can reach the Connector Manager. For example, try listing currently installed connectors (:ref:`List OCF Connectors and Their Properties <OCF_Maintain_Connectors-List_Connectors_Properties>`):

        .. code-block:: Bash

    	         alation_ypireti list

     This command should return a list of all currently installed connectors and demonstrate that Alation can communicate with the Connector Manager.

    - Check the log file **ypireti.log** in **/opt/alation/site/logs** (path inside the Alation shell) for any explicit error messages. Errors from ypireti.log are verbose enough and include enough instructions on how to debug and resolve an issue.

    - Check if the Connector Manager configuration is correct: :ref:`STEP 3: Configure Alation Connector Manager <OCF_Install_Alation_Connector_Manager-Configuration>`.

    - If your Alation application has been recently updated to a newer version, make sure that the Connector Manager has also been updated. If the Connector Manager version requires an update, the version mismatch between Alation and Connector Manager will also result in the *Unknown* status of the OCF connectors on the Manage Connectors dashboard.

If none of the troubleshooting tips listed above helped to identify the problem, contact Alation Support.

Failure during Installation, Upgrade, Delete, Start, Stop, and Restart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error occurs in the course of a connector management action, the corresponding error message will be displayed in the Log viewer area in the Alation UI. However, in some cases the error message will tell you to explore the ypireti.log file.

This log file is located in the standard Alation log location and is also downloadable from the **Logging** tab of the Admin section.

This log file will contain the normal output that you would get from running an ``alation_ypireti`` command on the command line. Errors from the ``ypireti`` client and Alation Connector Manager are verbose enough and include enough instructions on what has gone wrong for the issue to be debugged and resolved.

Missing Connector Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the details page for a connector, you may find that there are no Connector logs. The cause for this error is similar to the "status Unknown" error when reaching Alation Connector Manager.

Perform the steps in `Unknown Connector Status`_ to solve this issue.
