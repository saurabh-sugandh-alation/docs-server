Delete a File System Source
================================

*Available from Alation version 2023.3.3*

You can delete a File System source from Alation, which enables you to remove the file system sources that you no longer require. To delete a file system source, perform the following steps:

        .. note::

            The File System source deletion process is irreversible. Ensure that the source you delete is no longer needed and is safe to delete.

        .. note:

            To delete a File System source, you must be either a Server Admin or a Data Source Admin of the source.

  1. Go to the **Settings > General Settings** page of the File System source.

  2. Click **Delete**.

     A pop-up window appears to confirm the file system source name.

  3. Enter the file system source name in uppercase as displayed on the pop-up window and click Delete Permanently.

        .. note::

            The time taken to delete a File System source may vary based on the size.

     If you fail to delete a File System source, contact Alation Support.


Deletion in Progress Behavior
------------------------------------

During a deletion process, the UI behavior of the File System source will be as follows:


In **Sources > Browse Sources** tab:

      :align: center

In Sources > Manage Settings tab:

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------------

1. Why is my file system source disabled and showing a **Deletion in progress** message?

    If your file system source is large,  the deletion takes time. Wait for some time. If the issue persists for over a few hours, contact Alation  Support.

    Additionally, the delete process runs asynchronously. If multiple jobs, such as  MDE or QLI run in parallel, the delete process will take time to get its turn in the queue.

2. Why is my File System source disabled and showing a **Deletion failed** message?

    If the deletion process fails after multiple retries, the deletion failed message is displayed. Contact Alation Support for deletion failure.

3. The File System source was deleted; however, the search results still display the files, directory, and file attributes.

    For the large File System source, Alation clears the search results for the source in batches and it may take some time to remove all the search results. Wait for some time and contact Alation Support if the issue persists over a day.
