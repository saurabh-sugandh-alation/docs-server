Install Docker for Alation Versions 2020.3.x - 2021.1.x
=========================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Applies to Alation releases 2020.3.x - 2021.1.x*

The core software dependency for OCF and Alation Analytics V2 is Docker. Alation requires Docker version 18.09.1 or later. Steps to install Docker depend on the operating system of the Alation host.

To check if the host already has Docker installed:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        docker -v

If you are installing Docker for Alation Analytics V2, see `General Recommendations to Install Docker`_ below.

If you are installing Docker for OCF, then depending on the operating system of the host, you may be able to use Alation Connector Manager  installer to automatically install the required Docker version. Auto-installation is supported for AWS Linux 2, CentOS 7, and Ubuntu:
 :doc:`Auto-Install Docker as Alation Connector Manager Dependency <../../sources/OpenConnectorFramework/AutoInstallDockerAsDependency>`.

If auto-installation is not supported on the operating system of the host, Docker needs to be installed separately using general recommendations and as a prerequisite to installing Alation Connector Manager.

General Recommendations to Install Docker
---------------------------------------------

This section gives general instructions on how to install Docker in specific operating system environments. This applies to:

    - RHEL 7, 8
    - CentOS 8
    - OEL 7
    - Fedora 31, 32
    - Debian 10

To install Docker on any of these systems:

1. Navigate to `<https://download.docker.com/linux/>`_

2. Navigate to your appropriate distribution:

    - For Debian-based systems, it will look like **/linux/<OS>/dists/<VERSION>/pool/stable/amd64/**. For example: **/linux/debian/dists/wheezy/pool/stable/amd64/**

    - For RHEL-based systems, it will look like **/linux/<OS>/<VERSION>/x86_64/stable/Packages/**. For example: **/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/**

3. Pick an appropriate version number and download that version for all of the packages listed.

4. Install all packages that you downloaded using the appropriate package manager (APT or YUM). Note that these packages depend on each other, so in order to fulfill these dependencies you must install them all in the same invocation of the package manager. See examples below.

CentOS 8
''''''''''''

.. code-block:: Bash

    # SSH to the Alation host
    # As root, create a directory and navigate to this directory
    sudo su
    mkdir centos8
    cd centos8
    # Download the Docker packages
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.4.3-3.1.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-cli-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-rootless-extras-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    # Install the packages. Note that *.rpm is installing all of these packages at the same time, which is necessary to do
    yum install -y *.rpm

RHEL 8.x
''''''''''''

RHEL 8.x requires that you also install ``iptables`` or Docker will not start. For RHEL 8, use Docker packages for CentOS 8:

.. code-block:: Bash

    # SSH to the Alation host
    # As root, create a directory on the host and navigate to this directory
    sudo su
    mkdir rhel8
    cd rhel8
    # Download the Docker packages
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.4.3-3.1.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-cli-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/docker-ce-rootless-extras-20.10.2-3.el8.x86_64.rpm
    # Install the packages. Note that *.rpm is installing all of these packages at the same time, which is necessary to do
    yum install -y *.rpm
    #Install iptables
    yum install iptables

Debian 10
'''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: Bash

    # SSH to the Alation host
    # As root, create a directory on the host and navigate to this directory
    sudo su
    mkdir ubuntu20
    cd ubuntu20
    # Download the Docker packages
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/buster/pool/stable/amd64/containerd.io_1.4.3-1_amd64.deb
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/buster/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce-cli_20.10.2~3-0~debian-buster_amd64.deb
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/buster/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce-rootless-extras_20.10.2~3-0~debian-buster_amd64.deb
    curl -O https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/buster/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce_20.10.2~3-0~debian-buster_amd64.deb
    # Install the packages. Note that *amd64.deb is installing all of these packages at the same time, which is necessary to do
    apt install ./*amd64.deb


Oracle Linux 7 with RHCK
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: Bash

    # SSH to the Alation host
    # On the host, update YUM:
    sudo yum -y update
    # Enable the ol7_addons repo:
    yum-config-manager --enable ol7_addons
    # Install Docker:
    sudo yum install -y docker-engine

Start Docker
'''''''''''''''''

To start Docker:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo systemctl start docker

On Oracle Linux 7, you may need to enable Docker after starting it:

    .. code-block:: Bash

        sudo systemctl start docker
        sudo systemctl enable docker
