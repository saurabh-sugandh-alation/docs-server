OCF Connector for Amazon Athena: SSO with Compose
==================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

For Amazon Athena, Alation supports SSO with a SAML 2.0-compliant IdP and AWS IAM for Compose, dynamic sampling and profiling, query forms, and data upload.

If you have multiple Athena data sources, SSO authentication should be configured for each specific data source. Multiple data sources can use one and the same AuthService configuration object if authentication goes through the same authentication application in the same IdP.

    .. note::

        This configuration requires access to the backend of the Alation server. For Alation Cloud Service instances, create a support ticket with Alation requesting the configuration of SSO for Compose.
