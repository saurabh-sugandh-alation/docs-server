=======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst


A data source can be visible to all users or only to specific users and groups designated by a Data Source Admin. By default, a data source is visible to all users, or public. You can manage the visibility of a data source on the **Access** tab of the settings page:

  - `Configure Data Source Privacy`_
  - `Grant or Revoke Access`_

Configure Data Source Privacy
--------------------------------

To configure the data source visibility, use the two options under the **Data Source Privacy** section of the **Access** tab:

    - **Public Data Source**—The data source will be visible to all users of the catalog.
    - **Private Data Source**—The data source will only be visible to the users allowed access individually or through a group by a Data Source Admin.

Grant or Revoke Access
-------------------------------

Users can access a data source as *Data Source Admins* or *Data Source Viewers*:

    - **Data Source Admins**—The Data Source Admin access allows editing the settings page, including managing access to the data source, changing the connection parameters, scheduling and running metadata extraction (MDE), sampling and profiling, and query log ingestion (QLI).

    - **Data Source Viewers**—The Data Source Viewer access allows viewing the data source and its child objects in the catalog, including finding them with Alation Search.

For a private data source, you can add specific users or groups as Data Source Admins or Data Source Viewers.

For a public data source, you can add more Data Source Admins. All catalog users are Data Source Viewers by default.

You can also revoke access from users and groups.

    - `Manage Access to a Private Data Source`_
    - `Revoke Access`_
    - `Access for Server Admins`_

Manage Access to a Public Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage access:

1. Open the **Access** tab of your data source settings.

2. Under the **People** section, on the right of the **Data Source Admins** table title, click the **+Add** button. A quick search list will open.

3. Start typing the name of a user or group in the search field. Search will provide dynamic prompts that you can select from. Select the user or group you want.

4. The user or group you selected will be added to the **Data Source Admins** table. These users now have **Data Source Admin** access and can view and edit the data source settings.

Manage Access to a Private Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To grant or revoke access to or from users and groups:

1. Open the **Access** tab of your data source settings.

2. Under the **People** section, on the right of the **Viewers & Data Source Admins** table title, click the **+Add** button. A quick search list will open.

3. Start typing the name of a user or group in the search field. Search will provide dynamic prompts that you can select from.  Select the user or group you want.

4. The user or group you selected will be added to the **Viewers & Data Source Admins** table. Initially, all newly added users or groups are Viewers.

5. To change the access level to Data Source Admin, use the dropdown list in the **Access** Level column. Select **Data Source Admin** from the list.

Revoke Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To revoke data source access from a user or group:

1. Find the user or group you want in the **Data Source Admins** or **Viewers & Data Source Admins** table. (The table name depends on your data source privacy setting.) You can sort the **Name** column or use the filter on the top right of the table to find the user or group.

2. For this user or group, click **Remove** in the rightmost column of the table. The user will be removed from the table.

    .. note::

        You cannot remove the Data Source Admin access from the last remaining Data Source Admin.

Access for Server Admins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with the role of *Server Admin* can grant the Data Source Admin access to themselves on any data source.

To grant access:

1. As a Server Admin, open the catalog page of a data source.

2. On the top right of the page, click **More** and then **Settings**.

3. The **Edit Your Permissions to Access Settings** dialog will open. In this dialog, click **Go to Access**.

4. You'll land on the **Access** tab of the settings. Other tabs will be disabled until you've opened access to yourself. Use the information in :ref:`Grant or Revoke Access <access-grant-revoke>` to grant yourself access.
