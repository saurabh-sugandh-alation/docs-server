    This section is applicable to all Alation versions and Snowflake OCF Connector versions **prior to 2.2.9**.

If the database name is included in the JDBC URI, then metadata will be extracted only from that database. If the database name is not included in the JDBC URI, then all metadata that the service account has access to will be extracted, which may increase extraction time.

There is 45 minutes to 3 hour latency time to update tables, columns, views, primary keys, foreign keys, functions, and procedures in ACCOUNT_USAGE views. The new items created in databases can be extracted into the catalog after this latency time. Refer to `Account Usage â€” Snowflake Documentation <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#account-usage-views>`_ for information about the latency time for each item.

Customizing MDE
------------------

You can perform metadata extraction (MDE) based on default queries or configure it to use custom queries.

    .. note::

        From Snowflake OCF connector version **1.2.0.5882**, you can customize tag extraction. For more information on tags and tag links, see :doc:`/sources/OpenConnectorFramework/Snowflake/SnowflakeOCFConnectorExtractionQueries`.
