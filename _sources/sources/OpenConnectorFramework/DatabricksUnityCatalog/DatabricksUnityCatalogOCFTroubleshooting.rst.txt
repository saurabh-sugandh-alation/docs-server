Issues with Metadata Extraction
-------------------------------------

Problem: MDE fails with error "iterating schema children"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The issue may occur with older connector versions that use the legacy Spark driver. This driver sometimes cannot keep up the connection long enough for MDE to complete.

Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^

This issue was resolved starting with connector version **2.0.2.6259**, where the driver was changed to the Databricks JDBC driver. See more in :ref:`Build the JDBC URI <uc-build-uri>`.

Issues with Lineage Extraction
----------------------------------

Problem: After upgrading the connector to version 1.0.3, MDE fails at ingestion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connector logs will show the error "system.access.table_lineage table does not exist".

Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Direct lineage extraction from system tables is a beta feature. The lineage system tables are not enabled by default and need to be enabled by your Databricks admin. See more in :doc:`/sources/OpenConnectorFramework/DatabricksUnityCatalog/DatabricksUnityCatalogOCFLineageExtraction`.


Problem: No lineage is generated after MDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify that lineage data is available in the system lineage tables in Databricks.

Issues with QLI
--------------------

Problem: After running QLI, some queries donâ€™t appear in the History section of the Queries tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some SQL statements are currently not supported by the Databricks SQL parser that is used to parse SQL statements during QLI, for example:

    - Partially qualified names in SQL statements are not parsed. Object names in query history must be fully qualified to be ingested.
    - The USE statements are not parsed.
    - Queries containing CTEs are not parsed.
    - Queries containing comments (COMMENT, COMMENT ON) are not parsed

This is a limitation with the current GSP and a known issue.

Problem: After QLI, parts of a query appear as separate queries in the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To support proper query parsing, accurate execution times count, and lineage resolution, batched queries are split into individual query statements before ingestion.

Problem: Queries that appeared in Preview don't appear in the catalog after QLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Preview is not directly tied to queries that will appear in the catalog. It returns 100 statements which may be a subset of all imported queries. For queries to appear in the catalog after QLI:

    - Queries must contain fully qualified object names with three-level namespace (**catalog.schema.table**).
    - The objects referenced in queries must have been cataloged with MDE.
    - Queries must not duplicate identical queries that were ingested previously. Duplicate queries are not resolved.
