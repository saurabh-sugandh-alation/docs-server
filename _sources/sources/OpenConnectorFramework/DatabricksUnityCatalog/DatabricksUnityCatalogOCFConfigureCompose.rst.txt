Configure Compose
===================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Overview
---------------------------------

Compose is supported from connector version **1.0.2.3423**, compatible with Alation version 2022.4 or newer.

For details about configuring the **Compose** tab of the Settings, refer to :doc:`/sources/OpenConnectorFramework/ConfigureComposeforOCFDataSources`.

To establish a connection between Compose and Unity Catalog using basic authentication, Compose users will need their own personal access token or the knowledge of the token of the service account.

If you want to configure OAuth authentication for Compose, additionally see :doc:`/sources/OpenConnectorFramework/DatabricksUnityCatalog/DatabricksUnityCatalogOCFComposeOAuth`.


Incremental MDE from Compose
---------------------------------

When users create tables and views in Compose, Alation triggers a background extraction job to make the new table and view objects available in the catalog. As a result, users will see the corresponding table or view metadata in the data catalog without re-running MDE on the Settings page of the data source. When users run DDL SQL queries in Compose, incremental MDE also adds lineage information to the affected objects under the data source.
