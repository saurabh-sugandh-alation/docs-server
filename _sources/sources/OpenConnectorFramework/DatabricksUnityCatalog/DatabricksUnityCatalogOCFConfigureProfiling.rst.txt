Configure Sampling and Profiling
====================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Sampling and profiling, including dynamic profiling, is supported from connector version **1.0.2.3423**, compatible with Alation version 2022.4 or newer.

For details, see :doc:`/sources/OpenConnectorFramework/ConfigureSamplingforOCFDataSources`.

  .. important::

        To use custom query-based sampling and profiling, ensure that the JDBC URI includes the ``UseNativeQuery=0`` property.
        If you enable dynamic profiling, then users should ensure that their individual connections also include this property.
        Find more details about building the JDBC URI in :ref:`Build the JDBC URI <uc-build-uri>`.
