Versions Before 1.7.0
======================================================

.. important::

    This section is applicable to all Alation versions and Amazon Redshift OCF Connector versions **prior to 1.7.0**.


You can either create a table for Alation to pull the query logs from or use a custom query to query the logs from the Amazon Redshift data source.

Before performing query log ingestion (QLI), perform the QLI setup. Refer to :ref:`Redshift QLI Setup <Appendix_3>`.

Connector Settings
----------------------

Table-Based QLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the **Table Name** field, provide the name of the table in which the query logs are available. The table name must be provided in the following format: ``database.table``.

Custom Query-Based QLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you cannot create a table or view, you can use a Custom QLI Query to perform QLI. Provide the expected query structure as shown below and click **Save**:

.. code-block:: sql

      SELECT
          user_name AS username,
          to_char(start_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS.US') AS startTime,
          text AS queryString,
          session_id AS sessionId,
          seconds_taken AS seconds,
          'false' AS cancelled,
          default_database AS defaultDatabases,
          split_part(session_id, '/', 2) AS sessionStartTime,
          seq
      FROM
          public.alation_qlog
      WHERE
        starttime BETWEEN STARTTIME AND ENDTIME
        AND queryString IS NOT NULL
        AND queryString <> ''
        AND username != 'rdsdb'
      ORDER BY startTime, username, seq;
