Troubleshoot the OCF S3 Connector Configuration
===================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Terraform Configuration
--------------------------

  1. AWS Error while executing a script:

      - Make sure that you have provided a valid permission to the user which is used in the script

  2. Bucket missing error:

      - Make sure the buckets present in the source-bucket-list.json file exist in S3

  3. Access denied error:

      - Make sure you have required access while executing a script
      - Make sure you have added a correct region

  4. Cannot create a bucket error:

      - Make sure you have given required permission and also a unique name to target_bucket_for_inventory

  5. Cannot create a Lambda function error:

      - Make sure you have given required permission and also a unique name to lambda_function_name

Alation Configuration
-------------------------

1. Test connection issue:

      - Make sure the AWS access key and secret key is correct

      - Make sure you have provided the correct region

      - Make sure the user has access as described in :ref:`Configure Access and Permissions <set-up-s3-auth>`.

2. No inventory reports found:

      - Make sure that the destination bucket is correct

      - If the destination bucket is correct then wait 48 hours after setting up inventory for inventory generation and try again

3. MDE or filter extraction failure due to access issue:

      - Make sure the user has access to destination bucket

4. Duplicate columns when column name contains special characters:

      - After you upgrade the Amazon S3 OCF connector to version **3.8.6** or later, you may notice duplicate columns for columns with names containing special characters. To remove duplicates, enable **Remove Buckets from the catalog that are not captured by the lists below** before you run the next schema extraction.

          .. note::

              This will also remove all the buckets that are not part of the selective extraction list.

5. MDE or bucket list error:

      - **Error:**

          - File is initialized without providing a ``rootPath``

          - File path can't be null or empty

      - **Troubleshooting:**

          - Do not reuse buckets for the destination inventory bucket for this connector

          - Ensure that all buckets in the destination bucket are named properly

          - Verify the Inventory Configuration for each source bucket you are ingesting

          - If there is already a bucket path that has a blank name or a forward slash ``/`` in the destination inventory bucket, remove it. Review the inventory configuration for each source bucket


Lambda Function Logs
-------------------------

  1. Go to **Amazon S3 console > Lambda Functions** section.

  2. Select the lambda function that you have created and go to the **Monitor** section.

  3. Click **View Logs** in Cloudwatch. It will open in a new tab.

  4. In Cloudwatch, search for a particular log based on a date or prefix.

Also refer to :doc:`Troubleshooting </sources/OpenConnectorFramework/OCFTroubleshooting>`.
