Migrate Native Sources to Open Connector Framework
==============================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Overview
--------------

You can migrate a source that was previously cataloged using a native (built-in) connector to Open Connector Framework (OCF) if the corresponding OCF connector is available. The migration path is available for source types: RDBMS data sources and File System sources.

.. Important::

    You cannot migrate native BI sources to OCF connectors.

We recommend migrating to OCF to take advantage of the following benefits:

    - OCF connector releases are not tied to major Alation releases and follow their own  schedules with frequent delivery of bug fixes and improvements.

    - Unlike native connectors or Custom DB, OCF connectors can be upgraded separately from the Alation application when a new connector version becomes available.

    - OCF connectors are more scalable, flexible, and performant compared to built-in connectors.

    - Maintenance or upgrades of OCF Connectors can be self-serviced from the user interface.

    - In the coming releases, built-in connectors will be gradually deprecated.

    - OCF connectors provide additional features compared to the corresponding native connectors:

        - Deep column profiling
        - Query-based MDE
        - Query-based QLI

    - Built-in connectors will be gradually deprecated. Follow `Alation Community Blogs <https://community.alation.com/communityhubmicrosite/browse/blogs>`_ for the announcements.

.. note::

      Migration to an OCF connector is irreversible.We recommend saving the settings of your source or taking screenshots of the Settings page before performing the migration.
