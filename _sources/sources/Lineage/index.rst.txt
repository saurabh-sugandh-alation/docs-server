Lineage
=======================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Lineage* is data about the origin of data and its movement through an organization's data ecosystem. Lineage data documents how
target data objects are created from source data objects. Lineage is visually
represented as a :doc:`diagram <../../sources/Lineage/ReadLineageV2Diagram>` on the **Lineage** tab of a data source, BI source, or file system. Lineage diagrams frequently include :doc:`Dataflow <../../sources/Lineage/DataflowObjects>` objects, which can be used to document:

    - ETL and ELT processes
    - stored procedures
    - SQL queries
    - scripts that produce target data from source data

The lineage diagram brings together a target data object, its upstream sources, and the dataflow objects that track its movement, to fully represent the data ecosystem.

From version 2023.3, lineage can be displayed in either of two views: a *classic* view and a *compound layout* view. The compound layout view, currently in Beta release, groups lineage components by their 
top-level data source. For more information, see :doc:`Reading the Lineage Diagram </sources/Lineage/ReadLineageV2Diagram>`.

Types of Lineage
-----------------

There are two main types of lineage: table-level and column-level. Table-level lineage is the more common, as all types of lineage extraction are capable of producing it.  Column-level lineage is dependent upon both the data source and the data source connectors---currently, only some OCF connectors support column-level lineage. 

Alation automatically calculates lineage using metadata sourced from metadata
extraction (MDE), query log ingestion (QLI), Compose queries, and the data posted over the Alation public APIs. One part of MDE lineage extraction is *direct lineage*, which is lineage data extracted from system tables in certain databases such as :doc:`SAP HANA </sources/OpenConnectorFramework/SAPHANA/SAPHANAOCFConnectorInstallandConfigure>` and :doc:`Databricks Unity Catalog </sources/OpenConnectorFramework/DatabricksUnityCatalog/DatabricksUnityCatalogOCFInstallConfig>`. 

Table-level lineage is calculated for most sources, and column-level lineage is calculated for those sources whose connectors support it. Both table-level and column-level lineage can also be created manually or by using the Lineage API. For a complete list of OCF connectors that support column-level lineage, see the :doc:`Support Matrix </releases/supportmatrices/index>`.

Lineage Architecture
---------------------

The *lineage service*, introduced in Version 2021.4, is a microservice operating inside the Alation server. It is responsible for the creation, storage, and retrieval of lineage data into the catalog.

The Alation server creates lineage data from multiple sources, such as metadata extraction (MDE), query log ingestion (QLI), Compose query history, and public APIs. With Lineage V3 enabled, lineage events generated from these sources are sent to the Lineage V3 service via Event Bus. In the lineage service:

    - the lineage *write* service consumes lineage events from the Event Bus and stores this lineage data into the lineage database;
    - the lineage *read* service retrieves the stored lineage data and powers the lineage diagrams in the Alation user interface.

Enabling Column-Level Lineage
-----------------------------

For most connectors that support column-level lineage, column-level lineage is not calculated by default. You must first enable automatic extraction by setting a feature flag similar to the following on the :doc:`**Feature Configuration** tab of Alation's **Admin Settings** page </admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>`:

If you still do not see column-level lineage, check with your Alation account manager to ensure that column-level lineage for the specified connector is part of your Alation license entitlement.
