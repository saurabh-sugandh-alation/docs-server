Viewing Field History
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation tracks and displays history of edits of the fields on catalog
pages, such as **Title**, **Description**, **Summary** or **Stewards**.  
Some of these fields are permanent and always appear on catalog page 
templates, while others are Custom Fields that can be added or removed as 
necessary. Field values can be updated by users when they edit the fields 
manually or use a public API or upload a Data Dictionary; and by the system 
when specific system processes are run. Users can update fields for
individual catalog objects or bulk-edit similar objects through Catalog
Sets.

.. note::

    In field history, there is no distinction between a manual edit by a
    user and a value change by the Data Dictionary upload. 

Field history is available on pages of such objects as:

-  Data Source
-  Schema
-  Table
-  Column
-  File System
-  File
-  Catalog Set
-  API Resource

To view field history,

#. Sign in to Alation and open the catalog page of a data object.
#. Hover over the title of a field to reveal the **Clock** icon and click it to open the history of edits. History lists all the values that are applied to the field by users or the system and the time of the update. The edits appear chronologically, with the newest on top of the list.

.. note::

     History of edits was not tracked before release *5.3.0* where it was
     introduced for the Table objects. In release *5.6.0*, this
     functionality was extended to cover more object types. Thus, the
     field values migrated from older releases will be the starting point
     of field auditing in release *5.3.0* and onward.

Viewing Field History on Pages of Catalog Set Members
-----------------------------------------------------

Descriptions and Custom Fields on catalog pages of objects included into
Catalog Sets can be bulk-edited through the Set: when a value is updated
for the Set, it is automatically propagated to all its members. In this
case the history of edits will show which Catalog Set the value was set
through. The propagated values are marked with the **Gear** icon:

History of "Object Set" Type of Fields Updated Through Equivalence Sync
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For Alation objects that are included into a manual Catalog Set, there
is a way to synchronize custom fields on the "children" by toggling on Child Synchronization
(Equivalence Sync). For Object Set type of Custom Fields, the
history of edits will reflect such an update as replacement of all
values.

.. note::

     Field updates triggered by the Child Synchronization do not have a user
     identified for them in History because this process is run by the
     system.

Restoring Single-Value Fields
-----------------------------

For single-value Custom Fields, it is possible to restore an old value
from the History of field edits.

Values Modified Directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore an old value,

#. Hover over the title of the field and click the **Clock** icon to open the History.
#. Hover over the value you want to bring back and click **Restore** for this value. The old value will be returned to this field.

Values Modified Through Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For objects included into Catalog Sets, the custom field values which
are set through the Set can only be restored through this specific Set.
You need to be assigned the role of *Catalog Admin* or *Server Admin* to change
Catalog Sets.

To restore an old field value,

1. On the catalog page of an Alation object, click the **Clock** icon for the custom field you want to restore. The History of edits will open.
2. For the value to be restored, click the title of the Set. The Catalog page of this set will open. 

  .. note::

       There are alternative ways to open the Catalog Set page. For example,
       you can find the list of catalog Sets that an object is a member of
       under Properties on the right side of the **Overview** tab. Also,
       you can hover over the **Curate** menu on the main toolbar and in the
       list that opens, click **Catalog Sets** then find the Catalog
       Set under **All Catalog Sets**. Additionally, you can use Search
       to find the Set.

3. Click **Shared Fields** to open the page template of the objects in the Set.
4. Find the Custom Field you need to change and click its **Clock** icon. The History of edits will open.
5. Click **Restore** for the old value you want back. The restored value will be propagated to all the members of this Set.
