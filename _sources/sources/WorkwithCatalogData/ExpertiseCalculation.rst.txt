How Top User Expertise Is Calculated
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation calculates top user expertise for a data object based on several
factors: 

-  Number of the user’s queries that mention the data object;
-  Number of times the user added comments, titles, or descriptions to
   the data object page;
-  Nomination by other users.

Each user has a Catalog page where their expertise is listed, along with
the Catalog objects they are connected to and the queries they have
written.
