Columns and Samples
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

On table catalog pages, the **Columns** and **Samples** tabs provide granularity
into your data. 

On the **Columns** tab, a full list of the columns on your table is displayed:

On the **Samples** tab, by default, Alation scans the first 10,000 rows of
your table and stores the first 100 rows. The Samples tab displays a
random sample of 100 rows out of those 10,000 scanned rows:

 To change the default number of rows scanned and sampled, ask your
Alation admin.

If Dynamic Profiling is enabled for the data source, you’ll have to run the sample yourself by clicking the **Run Profile** or **Run Sample** button. You will need to enter user credentials for the data source. For help working with data source credentials, see :doc:`Working with Data Source Connections</analyst/UserAuthenticationForDataSources/WorkingWithDataSourceConnections>`.
