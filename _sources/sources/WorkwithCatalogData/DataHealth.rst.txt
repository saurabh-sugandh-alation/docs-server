*Applies from version 2022.2*

The *Open Data Quality Initiative* is an Alation innovation that provides a framework 
for tracking rule-based measures of data health, data reliability, and overall 
data quality within the Alation data catalog. Rules can be manually generated using 
the `Data Health API <https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/data_health_ingestion>`_ or automatically generated by any of several data quality 
software vendors, including Soda and BigEye. If Data Health information has been 
enabled in your Alation data catalog, any table with an associated Data Health rule 
will show an active **Health** tab.

Enable Data Health 
-------------------

Data Health is not active by default and can be enabled by a 
Server Admin. We recommend enabling Data Health on all Alation instances as it 
provides a useful framework for automating consistent data health observations 
across your data.

To enable Data Health, toggle **Enable Health Data** on the :doc:`Feature Configuration 
page of Administrator Settings </admins/AdminSettings/FeatureConfiguration>`.

View a Table with Health Information
------------------------------------

Once Data Health has been enabled and at least one rule defined using the API, you can view health information for any table to which a rule applies. For example, we defined 
a rule specifying that the ``season_number`` field in the Episodes table of the IMDb 
schema consists of only numeric data and similar rules checking that the episode title and parent TV show title consisted of string data. When we open the Episodes catalog page, we see the **Health** tab is active and the **Health** column shows the status of any rules applied to particular columns:

Our rules show the three types of status available in a health rule: Good, Warning, and Alert. The **Health** tab shows the most severe status indicated.

The **Health** column is also visible on the **Columns** tab:

Click on the Health tab to view the Data Health information for all active rules:

View Data Health Propagated Via Lineage
---------------------------------------

Beginning with Alation version 2022.4, you can see Data Health information propagated through Lineage. 

You can see Data Health information on downstream tables, BI data sources, or BI reports if any upstream objects have Data Health issues. If so, the **Health** tab will be active, and show the status of the most severe Data Health rule impacting the object:

    :class: with-border

Click the **Health** tab to view the Data Health information. Click the number beside **Upstream Issues** to view the **Upstream Issues** tab:

.. image:: ../../_static/DataHealth_UpstreamIssues2.png
    :class: with-border

Here you see the upstream source with data health issues, and a summary of the issues, which may include upstream object deletion. Click the down arrow to the right of this summary to see an expanded view of the information, including the rules that are in place and the objects they apply to:

View Data Health in Search Results
-----------------------------------

From release 2023.1, you can see Data Health alerts and warnings in search results.

For example, consider the spi_matches table with the following Data Health rules defined:

.. image:: ../../_static/DataHealth_RulesDefined.png
    :class: with-border

If we search for "spi_matches", we obtain the following results:

.. image:: ../../_static/DataHealth_SearchPropagation.png

The spi_matches table appears in the search results flagged with an Alert icon, because Alert is currently the most severe status in the table. If the most severe status was Warning, the Warning icon would be displayed.
