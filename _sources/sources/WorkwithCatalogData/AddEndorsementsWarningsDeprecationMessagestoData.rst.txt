Add Endorsements, Warnings, and Deprecation Messages to Data
=====================================================================

Alation makes it quick and easy to learn about the quality of data and
to review it. On every saved query, filter, column, table, schema, or
data source page you can Endorse, Warn, or Deprecate your data. Select
the green, yellow, or red circle next to the name of your data to
indicate its quality.

Have you found some great insights? Add an endorsement by clicking the
green circle. Are you aware of missing data? Add a warning (yellow
circle) with an explanation of the issue. In those cases where an object
should be avoided altogether, add a deprecation (red circle) to help
users steer clear of data quality issues; add a note and use the **@**
symbol to directly link to an alternative data object that will guide
users to authenticated data.

When a user puts a warning or deprecation on an object, Alation sends an
email to anyone that has mentioned it in a query, sharing the annotation
with them as well as links to their queries that are potentially
affected by it.
