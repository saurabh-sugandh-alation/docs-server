#. Drag and drop your file into the designated area, or click inside the area to select a file from your hard drive. Alation will recognize your column names, so you can use the same ones that are in your table. 

The data uploader is limited to 10,000 rows of data. Some target databases may have their own limitations and there may be a limitation based on your disk space or RAM.
