Struct Data Type in Hive Data Sources
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

*Available from release V R5 (5.9.x)*

Wide-column databases, such as Hive, can store composite data using
the *struct* data type. The catalog page of a struct column will fully
reveal the struct composition.

.. note::

    *Union* and *map* data types are not supported yet. If the map or
    union data types are used inside the struct, that struct field will
    not be displayed on the catalog page.

    Hive struct representation is only supported for the actual
    connection and not supported on Virtual Data Sources.

By default, the struct column catalog page will use the *Column* object
template. However, if you set the
flag ``alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_nosql_support`` in ``alation_conf``, then the
struct column catalog page will be using an additional second template:
the *NoSQL Attribute* object template that allows Alation to represent
the full structure of this column as a tree table.

Although the main purpose of this feature flag is to enable the support
for NoSQL databases in Alation, in addition, it will also enable the new
struct view.

Setting the Flag
----------------

.. include:: /shared/CloudMessages/CloudSupportRequest.rst

To set feature flags, you need SUDO access to the Alation host.

1. On the host, enter the Alation shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo /etc/init.d/alation shell

2. Enable the Generic NoSQL feature by setting the feature flag ``alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_nosql_support`` to ``True``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_nosql_support -s True

3. Restart uWSGI and Celery:

    .. code-block:: bash

       alation_supervisor restart web:uwsgi celery:*


    .. note::

        After enabling the flag, perform metadata extraction on your
        Hive data source with struct data types to see the changes to the struct
        representation in the existing metadata.


Viewing Struct Composition
--------------------------

Columns of type *struct* will be represented as a *schema object* in
Alation when the NoSQL Attribute template is applied. To reveal the whole
nested structure, you can expand each struct component down to the last
nested element. A struct column can include complex data types, such as
other structs and arrays, creating a complex structure. With the
expandable tree table representation, you can view all of them on one
catalog page.

You can drill down to the level of each individual data definition included in this struct.

.. note::

    NoSQL Schema objects are indicated with the icon:

    These objects can have an internal structure that includes both simple and complex data types.

Use of Object Templates for Struct Columns
------------------------------------------

Let us look at an example of a Hive data source that includes columns of the struct type.

When you open the catalog page of the source and drill down to the
struct column, it will be using the Column template. Custom fields
currently associated with this template will be on this page.

From the struct column page, you can drill down into any of the struct
components. They will use the NoSQL Attribute template.

When a data object in Alation uses the NoSQL Attribute template, the top
breadcrumbs use the noSQL data source icon set:
