Data Popularity
=====================================================================

Alation displays the popularity of your data on data Catalog pages. For
new users, the Popularity column is a quick way to assess which tables
have the most relevant information in a data source and which
tables are rarely used.

Popularity is relative to other objects in the same list. This means
that if the Popularity bar of one object is twice as long as the Popularity bar of another object in the
same list, the first item is used twice as often. However objects on
different catalog pages with Popularity bars of the same length are probably
not used equally as often.Â 

Popularity is determined through an algorithm that accounts for both
query ingestion (the number of data source accounts that used the object
and the number of times the object was used) as well as from Compose
usage (the number of Alation users that used the object and the number
of times the object was used).
