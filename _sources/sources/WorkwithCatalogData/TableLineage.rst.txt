Table Lineage
=====================================================================

.. include:: /shared/ProductLabels/CloudAndCustomerManaged_Label.rst

Alation displays the table lineage of data both ingested into and
created in Alation. Click the boxes and arrows to display additional
information, including the queries that created tables and how tables
connect to your BI reports. 

The lineage for any database in Alation is created by parsing queries,
both from the query log and directly from Compose, as well as view SQL.
As queries are parsed, Alation looks for CREATE, ALTER, INSERT
statements and uses that information to build the table-level lineage in
the graph. For Views, Alation will parse the view definition to
graphically connect it back to the tables used in its creation.

If you want to import lineage data from sources Alation does not natively support, you can do this using the Alation API.
