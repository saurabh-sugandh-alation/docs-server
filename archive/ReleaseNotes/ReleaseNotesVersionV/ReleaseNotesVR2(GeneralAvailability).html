<h2>Release V R2<a class="headerlink" href="#release-v-r2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<section id="new-features">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alation is more resilient to unresponsive data sources. Alation V R2
includes the following changes: 1. The timeout value has been
adjusted so that an unresponsive data source can no longer cause
Alation to crash. 2. If one data source becomes unresponsive, Alation
will still process queries executed on other data sources. In order
to improve resiliency, this version of Alation has a data migration
that may require more disk space. The installer will check if there
is enough space to proceed, and it will halt the update if there is
not enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, only individual users could be added as members of a
private data source and get access. Now, Alation supports adding
groups as members of a private data source.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation can now be deployed in a Docker container.</p></li>
<li><p>The Trust Check highlight makes it easier for analysts to see quality
flags on data on their queries. Object flags, including endorsements,
warnings, and deprecations are now also shown when hovering over a
Trust Check highlight.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom JDBC drivers can be provided and used in place of the standard
ones packaged with Alation. In addition, when adding a new data
source, you can now choose “Custom DB” to connect to a database that
is not supported natively by Alation by providing a JDBC driver. This
driver will be used to extract metadata, perform profiling, and
enable Compose for that data source.</p></li>
<li><p>The custom fields on tables, files, file systems, and BI objects will
show the history of changes to the field. A clock icon is visible by
each field. Click the clock to bring up a modal which displays the
past history of changes to the field. The changes include the time,
contents, and author of the change. Custom field history for Data
Sources, Schemas, and Columns as well as history for tags and flags
will be available in upcoming releases.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports EMR Hive query log ingestion from an Amazon S3
repository with Hive running on MapReduce engine.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can filter query search under the Search menu in the top
navigation to show scheduled queries. The results display the
information about the schedule for each query, when it was last run,
and whether the last run was successful. An indicator shows if the
query schedule is paused by the user or by the system (if the query
has unsaved changes for instance). The schedule can now be enabled or
disabled by the author, or by any administrator.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports cataloging API Resources as a part of Alation
Data Catalog. With this capability, an enterprise has a single
location to discover all available APIs, the end points for these
APIs, and the schemas for their input and output . These APIs can be
grouped into folders and subfolders for easy discoverability. In
addition, these catalog entries can take advantage of all the Alation
capabilities such as Advanced Search, Collaborate with others over
the APIs and so on. The feature
flag alation.feature_flags.enable_api_resource needs to be turned on
for the feature to function. For further details and code samples,
refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.alation.com/dev/">API documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p>For customers with Salesforce Einstein Analytics connected to
Alation, the Analytics dashboard will be certified when the
equivalent dashboard is endorsed in Alation.
Note:
1) Users of Salesforce Einstein Analytics can enable this integration
from Alation Labs.
2) When dashboard in Alation is endorsed, warned, or deprecated,
Alation intimates this change to Salesforce Einstein Analytics as
follows:
a) If a dashboard has been marked as deprecated by a single user,
then, the prefix DO NOT USE is added to the dashboard title in
Salesforce.
b) If a dashboard has not been deprecated or warned by anyone, but
endorsed by a single user, then, the prefix CERTIFIED is added to the
dashboard title in Salesforce.
3) If a user manually edits the title in Salesforce and removes the
prefix, then, the next metadata extraction job runs in Alation and
reverts the title to the dashboard.
4) The service account associated with the Salesforce Einstein
Analytics instance in Alation needs to have “Manage Dashboard”
permission in Salesforce for all the folders (shared, private, and so
on).</p></li>
<li><p>Alation enables searching of words which begins with one lowercase
letter followed by multiple upper case letters. Example: The word
“iPOD” can be found by searching for “ipod” or “iPOD” or “iPod”.
Alation has also enhanced support for searching words with camel
case. Example: The word “DataCatalog” can be looked at by searching
“data catalog” or “DataCatalog,” but not by searching “datacatalog”.
Now “datacatalog” would also match “DataCatalog”. Note that this
change will not take effect immediately after an upgrade. The search
index will be updated later in a background job run on weekend hours.
These changes will gradually take effect after the upgrade process.</p></li>
<li><p>The Explain button has been enabled in Compose for DB2 and Oracle
data sources to simplify generation of an explain plan.</p></li>
<li><p>After executing a query in Compose that results in an error, the link
to the error can be shared with the context of the statements
executed in the session. In the results pane, select the “More” menu
and then select “View in catalog” to see the page, or “Share” to send
the link to a colleague.</p></li>
<li><p>Significant improvements  are made in the API for uploading catalog
metadata (Virtual Data Source APIs): The API is at parity with our
custom connectors and all enhanced metadata can now be uploaded
through API and bulk upload (CSV). Compose (the Alation Query Editor
and Execution tool) can now be enabled for virtual data sources by
adding a compatible JDBC driver in General Settings page. For more
information, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.alation.com/dev/">API documentation</a>.</p></li>

<section id="id2">
<h4>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Any user can be designated as a Data Source Admin for a particular
data source and manage its configuration. The Server Admin can
delegate configuration of a data source to regular users by assigning
them to be the Data Source administrator of that data source.
Additionally, private data sources now support adding groups of users
as viewers.
The Data Source Admin can configure the data source settings,
including configuring the URI and credentials, scheduling the
metadata extraction, profiling, and Query Log ingestion(QLI) jobs.
The list of Data Source administrators can be configured from the new
tab called “Access”, which is available on the Data Source settings
page. The Data Source Admin can also manage the list of users who
have access to a private Data Source from the “Access” tab.
A new menu called “Sources” is added in the top navigation bar. This
allows any user to see the list of available sources (Data Source,
BI, File Systems) and the list of sources they can configure as Data
Source administrators. The Deployment Command Center is moved from
the Admin Settings page to the “Sources”menu. The search
functionality is updated to manage the permission to reflect the
changes to the viewers of a data source immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports compose, metadata extraction, sampling, and query
log ingestion from Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) (Version
16.0 SP03) as a data source. This can be configured by following the
steps in the Add New Data source page in Admin settings. To enable
the addition of this data source, turn on the feature flag:
alation.feature_flags.enable_datasource_sybasease
Lineage is unavailable for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports metadata extraction and lineage from SQL Server
Reporting Service (SSRS) (Version 14) as a BI server. This can be
configured by following the steps in the Add New BI Server page in
Admin setting. alation_conf enables the functioning of this feature.
Set the generic bi flag and SSRS flag as follows:
alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_generic_bi -s True
alation_conf alation.feature_flags.enable_ssrs_bi -s True
The preview of mobile reports is unavailable for this release. User
permission cannot be viewed for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>The API allows users to upload the details of an API Resource that
are displayed in Alation Catalog. An API Resource consists of a URL,
a HTTP method, a response type, a JSON Schema describing the input(s)
to the API Resource, and a JSON Schema describing the output. Using
this API, you can: Create new API Resource Catalog Pages and place
them under folders. - Retrieve an existing Resource - Update the
details of an existing API Resource, or relocate it - Delete an API
Resource. The given resource will be marked deleted, but can be
restored. The administrator can only create or update the API
resource using this API.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports compose, metadata extraction, sampling, query log
ingestion, and popularity for AWS Glue (Version 2017-03-31 ) as the
Hive metastore replacement. This can be configured by following the
steps in the Add New Data source page in Admin setting. Lineage is
not supported for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports compose, metadata extraction, sampling, query log
ingestion, lineage, and popularity for Amazon Redshift Spectrum (Version
1.0.1385) as a data source. This can be configured by following the
steps in the Add New Data source page in Admin setting. Showtable is
not available for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports compose, metadata extraction, sampling, and query
log ingestion for Snowflake (Version 2.34.0) as a data source. This
can be configured by following the steps in the Add New Data source
page in Admin setting. Popularity is supported for this release via
Compose and Query log ingestion. However, the table name must be
fully qualified. Example: Sample- dbName.schemaName.tableName.
Queries run using partially qualified names via schema selector does
not get ingested. So, the popularity for such queries will not be
calculated. Foreign key is also not supported for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports metadata extraction from Azure Data Lake Store
(Version Gen1 ) as a file system. This can be configured by following
the steps in the Add New Data file system in Admin setting. File and
folder names with special character is unavailable for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports compose, metadata extraction, sampling, and query
log ingestion from Google Big Query (Version 2 ) as a data source.
This can be configured by following the steps in the Add New Data
source page in Admin setting. Lineage and popularity are unavailable
for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>The administrator can see the background tasks running on Alation and
terminate a specific task. However, manual termination of these tasks
should be used sparingly.This
feature is available under Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Monitor page, which
displays a tab of active and queued task and a tab that displays
recently completed task.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation Server upgraded its connector from running on Java 8 to Java
9. This should be invisible to end users of Alation. However, there
is one case where a configuration update may be needed. Data sources
that use kerberos authentication could be impacted if the
“renew_lifetime” parameter is incorrectly configured in the krb5.conf
file. This parameter was ignored by Java 8 and Java 9 added support
for it. So, if this was set previously in a way that would not work,
the connector would have ignored it and connected successfully. If
you have a kerberized data source and encounter error messages in the
logs that say “message stream modified,” then, check if this
renew_lifetime parameter is set and try commenting it out and
restarting. This will only impact customers who have added custom JVM
flags through the `taskserver.extra_flags` or
`connector.extra_flags` settings. Alation supported a setting to
pass custom flags to the JVM running some of the Alation services.
Since Alation upgraded to using Java 9, it is possible that one of
these custom flags is no longer supported. If that is the case, then
the TaskServer and Connector would not start until the offending flag
is removed from “taskserver.extra_flags” and “connector.extra_flags”.
Some known flags that might have been added are related to GC
logging. For additional information,
see <a class="reference external" href="https://dzone.com/articles/disruptive-changes-to-gc-logging-in-java-9">https://dzone.com/articles/disruptive-changes-to-gc-logging-in-java-9</a>.</p></li>

<h4>Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previously, the  public push API for generic BI populated only the
physical data. Now, the public push API will populate physical data
and create lineage by using JSON data from the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Uploading a file with a password column will cause the password for
all users in the upload to be set appropriately. This is a workaround
for creating a non-SSO user in an SSO-enabled environment. However,
it is not possible to update the password of an existing user during
user profile upload.</p></li>
<li><p>The time of endorsement/warning/deprecation note from the previous
calendar year is now displayed in a user friendly manner.</p></li>
<li><p>The user can now check the status of all Alation processes using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/init.d/alation</span></code> command. This is helpful when users try to debug
outage.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation installer will ensure that necessary users and groups are
created. If there is a problem with the creation of users and groups,
the installer will exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Watchers and stewards will receive an email notification when the
article gets deleted from Alation.</p></li>
<li><p>The installer will check <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code> and will abort if the device is
invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Enable automatic archiving” checkbox is selected as default
under the ‘Archive processed QLI data’ section on the admin/misc
settings page. If this checkbox is selected, the archival of the
processed QLI data happens at two pm every Saturday. If this checkbox
is not selected, the job will be run at 10pm every Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>When performing trust check, Alation offers the choice of retrieving
the correct flag for the table. This resolves the ambiguous tables
and attributes to the schema displayed in the schema selector.</p></li>
<li><p>To get the full version of Alation installation, ‘/full_version’ can
be used. Example: <a class="reference external" href="http:alation.corp.com/full_version">http:alation.corp.com/full_version</a>. However, the
order of items in the result was indeterminate. In this release, the
order of the data is fixed and the result will conform to a
predefined order.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation tries to guess the title of data objects. Previously, it
would never guess names that contained digits, even if it could guess
the non digit part of the name. Now, it will attempt to guess names
containing digits. For example, if an object named “eml_addr” was
guessed to be “Email Address” and another object was named
“eml_addr1”, no guess would have been made for “eml_addr1”. Now, it
might be guessed as “Email Address 1.”</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Alation was not able to use directories other than
standard /home/alation and /home/alationadmin for Linux accounts.
Alation now supports non-standard system home directory and shell for
Linux accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Alation did not take into account the recency of usage
when calculating popularity. Now, Alation provides object popularity
weighted by the recency of usages. To enable it inside chroot, turn
on the feature flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alation_conf</span> <span class="pre">alation.feature_flags.enable_popularity_aging</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">True</span></code>.</p></li>

<h4>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Updating filesystem objects with mixed case names using upload
logical metadata API did not work and threw an error saying that the
object was not found. Users can now update logical metadata for
Directories and Files with mixed case names.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug introduced in 5.0.5 that prevented new users from signing
up with SAML authentication. In 5.0.5-5.0.6, new users would
experience errors when signing up for the first time by
authenticating with their SAML credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, disabling Compose for a data source would prevent new
queries from being created, but would still allow users to run
existing queries on that data source. Now, if the data source is
disabled (that can be done from General Settings on any Data Source
Settings page) will also prevent Compose from connecting to the data
source or running existing queries.</p></li>
<li><p>The usage.page_visit was displaying the incorrect object ID value of
column objects for customers using the Alation database. Now, the
object_id values in column objects should have integer ID that can be
joined with ‘objects.columns’ table.</p></li>
<li><p>The Business Intelligence Catalog Browser would repeatedly search for
more BI Servers. This issue has been resolved and memory usage
has significantly improved.</p></li>
<li><p>If an admin user attempted to upload user profiles with usernames
that start with one or more 0s, then, the leading 0s would be
stripped. Now, the user profile uploader will work correctly with csv
files having numeric usernames starting with 0s.</p></li>
<li><p>Authors of saved queries receive email notification with a list of
affected queries when a table is marked as deprecated or when a
warning is added. Previously, this notification included deleted
queries. Now, the notification will only include active queries.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Query catalog page, you can see a clock icon by the title that
will open a modal showing the history of title changes to that query.
Previously, this modal was not available for users who did not have
permission to edit the title. Now, even users who cannot edit the
title can see the title history because anyone who has permission to
view the title should be able to see the title history.</p></li>
<li><p>The title for a Salesforce Einstein BI Report in Alation was
different from the title in the Salesforce Einstein Analytics Report.
This issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>For instances with a high rate of metadata changes, the Metadata
Change Log can get large enough to cause an error on metadata
extraction, with the message: “DataError: integer out of range.”
This version includes a new flag to temporarily disable Metadata
Change Log if you have encountered this situation.  In the Alation
shell, use the command “alation_conf alation.enable_
metadatachangelog -s False” to disable the feature and get metadata
extraction working again.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation stripped authentication information from the URI used for
Hive/Impala QLI. This information is now properly passed to the
server.</p></li>
<li><p>If the edit permission of Articles displayed in the Alation home page
for some users are modified, then, other users could not load the
home page and would get a 500 error. The edit permission on the
article is restricted and other users can load the home page and see
the articles, but cannot edit them.</p></li>
<li><p>Reloading the permission page under Admin Settings caused the page to
crash if permission was added for BI site, BI Project or BI Workbook.
The page no longer crashes when permission is added for BI site, BI
Project, or BI workbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation was using a different service account for datadog service. To
simplify the installation process, the data dog agent now runs as
Alation user.</p></li>
<li><p>The admin users were not able to delete shared flags on catalog set
even though they were the author of the flag. Now, an admin user will
be able to remove flags added by them or by other users.</p></li>
<li><p>Data that can be queried using the Compose tool sometimes failed to
get profiled. Parsing of the results of the data profiling job is now
consistent with Compose.</p></li>
<li><p>When mentioning users in a conversation, the display name in the
email received by the user is the display name set in admin settings
-&gt; Email Server.</p></li>
<li><p>The BindDN and BindPassword fields were not visible on the LDAP
Authentication Settings page for Admin user. This was an issue with
Internet Explorer.</p></li>
<li><p>Schema with the same name and multi part name did not show up
correctly in search when search de-duplication was turned on.
Previously if there were two schema named ‘public.sales’ and ‘sales’,
and when users searched for ‘sales’, only one of them showed up. Now,
the schema with same name and multi part name shows up.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, a scheduled query would fail unnecessarily in rare cases
(if the scheduling user had never connected via Compose to the
associated data source using a URI that matches the default URI for
that data source). Now those scheduled queries will run successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>If the administrator clicks “Activate All Pending,” it activated only
one user from the list of pending users. Now, all pending users will
be activated when the administrator clicks ” Activate All Pending.”</p></li>
<li><p>If a non-integer ID is used for querying a resource, a value of 400
is returned now. Previously, the ReportResource API returned 500.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, users in Compose could end up in a state where the filter
popover menu would stick around when compose tabs are changed using
hotkeys. Now, the filter popover goes away when the users change
compose tabs using hot keys.</p></li>
<li><p>The table of Virtual Data Sources displayed a column count of zero.
The proper number of columns will now be displayed after running
Metadata Upload on virtual data sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Tableau lineage will now work even in the presence of a three-level schema
(server(catalog).database.schema), created using linked
servers. The parsing of Tableau connection information is fixed for
Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p>When images are added to an article, a button is available to set the
size of images. Previously, when the user clicked this button, the
dialog to enter the size of the image was very small. So, it was not
possible to understand the content or to make any edits. This dialog
is now rendered properly.</p></li>
<li><p>The data object name uploaded to a virtual data source using the
metadata upload tab is displayed in lowercase. The character casing
presented in the uploaded metadata file is now properly preserved in
the Alation UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrading to a new version of Alation with lower build number left
the server in inconsistent state. This has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user adds or removes tags from object pages, the stewards and
watchers cannot get email notification. The notification of tags for
both single object and cognate sync is added now.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata extraction remained stuck in the “STARTED” state when the
celery worker was killed. Now, the Metadata extraction job status
will get updated to “FAILED” when a celery worker is killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Unsaved queries that are viewed in catalog will display N/A for “last
saved.”</p></li>
<li><p>The commented text is more visible in the dusk theme of compose due
to enhanced highlighting colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Tableau lineage can now properly distinguish between databases that
have the same host, but different ports.</p></li>
<li><p>A suspended user would see the “Awaiting approval” message after
logging on to Alation using SAML. Now, the suspended user will see
the “Account Inactive” message. The suspended user will be
automatically logged out.</p></li>
<li><p>The inconsistent lower casing of schema and table names throughout
the UI has been resolved. Alation will now display the table and
schema name in appropriate casing.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled jobs including metadata extraction, profiling, scheduled
queries and so on continued to get executed even after the server
class instance was deleted. Examples of server class instance include
BIServer, FileSystem, data source, and ReportServer.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata extraction used to fail for SQL server configured to use a
case sensitive server collation. Support has been added for SQL
server instances with case sensitive collation.</p></li>
<li><p>Dimensions and Measures are now getting extracted correctly for
Cognos BI source.</p></li>
<li><p>In MicroStrategy, Emmacubes are treated as reports that have a
variable subtype EmmaCube which in turn differentiates them as Cubes.
Alation now extracts measure and dimension from the cube data sources
and also adds missing lineage for dashboards.</p></li>
<li><p>Users were not able to search for articles within custom template
facets in advanced search. This has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>The extraction crashed with an infinite loop on a Microstrategy
server if a subfolder contained a shortcut to any of its parent
folders. Seamless extraction takes place irrespective of the
existence of shortcut to the parent folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation provides SSL/TLS encryption support for Oracle/Vertica and
MySQL connectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, users who have been suspended from Alation would still
show up in search results. Now, when a user is suspended, they will
be removed from the search results. Note that this will not apply
retroactively to users suspended before this change. Those users will
be removed from search the next time the search is re-indexed.</p></li>
<li><p>The vertical text alignment in tables now persist in the article
editor.</p></li>
<li><p>The untitled articles would show up blank under Relevant Articles on
catalog pages. Now, we show “Untitled Article” with the article’s ID.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, users could not see that their profile picture changed
when they uploaded a new one. This was because browsers were caching
the image and the name of the image was re-used when the picture was
changed. The picture would actually be changed, but they would not
see it for a long time because of this cache. Now, the image name is
different. So, users will immediately see their new profile picture
after it is changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, on the lineage tab of the catalog page, only the links
between a deprecated parent and its immediate children were displayed
in red. Now, all the links from a deprecated parent to its
descendants at all levels are displayed in red.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Amazon S3 extraction worked if a folder is specified, but failed
for full extraction. The recursion technique used in the call to S3
for bucket objects has been replaced by the
do-while loop. So, Alation can now support more than 10 million
objects of an S3 bucket.</p></li>
<li><p>The object names beginning with unicode characters would cause
Metadata Extraction to fail. This issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously (since 4.17), if a Tableau Extraction or Virtual Data
Source upload job was killed while in progress, then, the UI would no
longer show the status of any current or past jobs of that type. The
actual jobs would continue to run on schedule, but would not be
visible on the settings page. This could happen if the machine or
server was restarted in the middle of one of these jobs or if they
were killed by the OS or a system admin. Now, current and past
Tableau Extraction and Virtual Data Source upload jobs will show
regardless of whether one of them has been killed while it was in
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The video files were being uploaded to an external website. Video
uploading is now disabled. Any uploaded videos were deleted from the
external server. Users can still embed video files from Youtube,
Vimeo and other sources.</p></li>
<li><p>If a dashboard-type report comprises simple reports, then, the
‘Dashboard’ section lists them as a link on the report catalog page
using the generic BI framework.</p></li>
<li><p>The date selection dropdown in compose’s schedule query modal was
hidden inside the modal. This made it difficult to select the date.
Now, the dropdown will appear outside the modal which makes it easier
to select the date.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation offers the following pre-packaged custom fields : Stewards,
Status, Expert In, Working on, and Interested In. Users can now
delete the custom fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Mention of &#64; in conversation/description/article only works at the
beginning of the line in Internet Explorer.</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate file handling in filesystem metadata extraction is more
robust.</p></li>
<li><p>The content of View text in the Table Catalog overview tab and
metadata extraction will appear in the same case.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the download logs failed when permission was denied on
any log file for the admin user. Now, Alation will skip such log
files that do not have permission and display a message showing the
list of skipped files.</p></li>
<li><p>Uploading virtual data source for a database having multi-part schema
names (Example: Amazon Redshift) now works. Previously, upload to database
like MySQL worked, but failed on database types that supports
multi-part schema.</p></li>
<li><p>When using compose in the evergreen theme, the ‘x’ to close the
current active query tab will now be an accented orange on hover and
does not disappear.</p></li>
<li><p>If an entire query is cut and pasted repeatedly, the semantic check
will run after you stop cutting and pasting the query.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, it was possible to click the ‘Save’ button again even
while the first save was in progress, causing multiple requests to be
sent that could have a performance hit on the Alation server. Now,
the ‘Save’ button is not disabled after saving changes to Catalog Set
Rules (for both new and existing sets).</p></li>
<li><p>Opening the Select Templates modal in Custom Glossary in IE 10 or IE
11 would cause the list of templates not to be shown.</p></li>
<li><p>The installer logs can now be downloaded as part of the Encrypted
Logs download after the Alation Upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>The unqualified tables were not ranked by popularity in SmartSuggest.
Now, typing
“SELECT FROM ” should suggest the most popular tables in that data
source first.</p></li>
<li><p>A change in the title of the picker option in the advanced search
facets still showed the old name. Reindex is added to update the
option.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Open With” menu appear on schema, table, and column pages even
if there were no applications available in the menu. Now, the “Open
With” menu only appears if there are available applications.</p></li>
<li><p>The filtering by name parameter for report collection and report
object object types in Business Intelligence Report Browsing API would
throw ‘500 Internal Error’. Now, filtering by name parameter returns
results matching the name value passed.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if the TeraData data source is set up without an explicit
query log table, clicking “Test” in the “Query Log Privileges”
section of “General Settings” does not choose the default table. This
is resolved now and will use the default table if user does not
provide the explicit table name in query log privileges section of
General Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>The Admin user can go to the settings page and send a test email to
themselves to test the email server status and verify that the
notification service is working. In some cases, even if the test
email was sent successfully, the actual notification did not reach
the end users. This is resolved such that whenever the email gets
sent successfully, the notifications are also delivered successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>The Article editing window used to jump to top of page in HTML mode.
Now, Article Editing in code view (HTML mode) no longer auto scrolls
to the top of the page while in edit mode.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On the General Settings tab of data source settings page, you can
select which JDBC driver to use to connect to the data source.
Previously, the end of the driver name cannot be seen because they
were cut off. This made it impossible to pick the correct driver when
two drivers have nearly the same name with a different suffix
(version 5.4.0). Now, the drop-down selector should expand to show
the full name for all the built-in drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Alation would not be able to parse encrypted assertion
when authenticating a user with SAML. The failure to parse encrypted
assertions is only for 5.0.5-5.0.9 and 5.4.0 versions. Now, this has
been resolved. SAML HTTP POST binding is not supported now.</p></li>
<li><p>The support for Google BigQuery has been improved. Alation can now
resolve partially qualified table names that appear in queries
collected from query log ingestion. These queries will appear in the
tables’ query history.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports Hive servers configured with both Kerberos and
HTTP transport mode. Previously, Compose and profiling would fail
when attempting to run them on Hive data sources in this
configuration (version 5.4.0).</p></li>
<li><p>Alation natively supports the connection to Hive data sources that
use the specific combination of Kerberos authentication over SSL.
Previously, this was supported through a special configuration and
the customer would have to install a custom driver given to them by
Alation support (version 5.4.0). Now, this driver is selected through
the user interface on the general settings page. Customers who had
the old solution configured will need to migrate to the new one. To
do this, go to the general settings page of the data source which has
this configuration and select the
hive-driver-1.1.1-kerberos-ssl-patched driver.</p></li>

<li><p>Profiling is now supported for the following data sources (version
5.4.4):
•  Azure Data Warehouse
•  SAS</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the column profiling failed for SAS causing a null
pointer exception to occur (version 5.4.4). This issue has been
resolved and the user can now successfully profile individual columns
for SAS.</p></li>
<li><p>The version of the Data Source API in Alation V R2 omitted a field
necessary to set up a data source with scheduled metadata extraction
(version 5.4.0-5.4.4). Now, the disable_auto_extraction field can be
set to false to make the extraction run.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When the new feature API Resources is turned on in version
5.4.0-5.4.5 (alation.feature_flags.enable_api_resource feature flag
is set to True), then the keyboard navigation of the search results
in the main search box in the left-hand navigation does not work
correctly. It is still possible to click the result with your mouse
but not to navigate to the result with the up and down arrows.</p></li>

executed in a single run, and one of the statements takes an
execution time greater than 30 seconds to complete, then, the error
“Query aborted without returning a result” occurs. This issue has
been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when the description for filesystem objects was updated

<li><p>Previously, there was a persistent XSS attack on the user profile
page. This allowed a user with a valid Alation account to execute
JavaScript in the browser of another Alation user. Any user with an
Alation account could create an article and put a script tag in the
title of that article. Anyone who browses to the user’s profile page
would trigger the execution of the script. The link to the page to
trigger the script could be sent to other users. Now, the Article
titles will not be executed on the user profile page.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the upgrade process may destroy customer dataset when
/opt OR /opt/alation are symlinks. All upgrade to V R2 must use 5.4.8
build or above.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, custom picker fields would throw an error when unicode
characters were added when configuring their values. Now, unicode
characters is supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, metadata extraction failed with an error serializing
dbobjects when the data type was null for Oracle data source. This
issue is now resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now enforces Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
signature validation to avoid potential privilege escalation attack
in SAML authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the upgrade process from v5.0.3 to v5.4.7 of Alation
could fail sometimes due to the migration of custom field data. The
upgrade process from v5.0.3 to v5.4.7 is now successful.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if the user drags and drops a file into an article while
editing it, the file was temporarily saved outside Alation. Now,
these files are stored inside Alation.
The size of image inserted in an article should not exceed
ALATION_MAX_UPLOADED_ATTACHMENT_FILE_BYTES size. This limitation is
enforced now for images inserted into an article using the
corresponding widget.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the customers’ upgrade (version lower than 4.18 to higher
version) might have failed during the migration of object
equivalences to catalog sets since the equivalence of schema had
millions of tables or columns. This fix resolves the migration error.</p></li>

<h2>Release 5.4.10 - Security Patch<a class="headerlink" href="#release-5-4-10-security-patch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This patch is a critical fix that addresses the security vulnerability
with logging which has been described in the recent Security bulletin:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="summary">
<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist with debugging, the Alation application writes
exceptions to log files. Alation’s codebase includes an open-source
third-party exception-logging library called Raven. We recently
discovered that Raven has an undocumented bug such that it sometimes
logs usernames and passwords stored in the application memory to the
Alation log files in cleartext.</p>
<p>In this patch we completely deactivate Raven. Originally, we included
the Raven capabilities into Alation to have the richest possible logs
for rapid issue resolution. Although without Raven certain issues may be
more difficult to diagnose, we will continue to have other logging
information. There are no plans on adding those exception-logging
capabilities back, presently; we will rely on other kinds of logs and
monitoring for diagnosis of issues.</p>
<p>It is of paramount importance that this security patch is installed by
all customers.</p>
<p>Note that this patch does NOT remove any of the existing logs
from your Alation instance. If you have not purged the existing logs as
part of the security bulletin recommendations, please consider doing so
after you install the patch. For instructions, see Section IV-B of the security bulletin April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers.</p>
