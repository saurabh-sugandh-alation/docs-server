<h3>Improved MicroStrategy Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#improved-microstrategy-integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Alation has improved integration with MicroStrategy and now provides the
following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The MicroStrategy directory structure is now visible when users view
the dashboard or reports under a project. This helps to identify the
source of the dashboard or report.</p></li>
<li><p>The Report or Dashboard fields will use terminology pertinent to the
BI source. Report fields in MicroStrategy will be referred to as
Metrics and Attributes. The terminology of Measures and Dimensions
will be used for report fields for other BI tools.</p></li>
<li><p>The report metadata is successfully extracted for MicroStrategy
reports created using object prompt or hierarchy prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Metrics and Attributes extracted from MicroStrategy Servers now have
their own catalog pages where the Description and Steward fields can
be curated.</p></li>

<h3>Inbox (Beta)<a class="headerlink" href="#inbox-beta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this Beta version, Alation users will be able to see conversation
updates and task notifications in their new Inbox. In addition to the
separate designated Inbox page accessible from the main toolbar, there
is My Inbox section on the Stewardship Dashboard. Granular details of

<section id="catalog-activity-report">
<h3>Catalog Activity Report<a class="headerlink" href="#catalog-activity-report" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Data Stewards now have the ability to monitor curation changes to data
objects that they manage. Using the Catalog Activity report, they can
review updates to data objects, catch any inaccurate changes and restore
an older value if necessary. Catalog Activity report provides detailed
information about each change including the time of the change, the user
who made the change, and the actual modification that took place. Data
Stewards can utilize easy-to-use filters to zoom in and out of the data.
The Catalog Activity report is available as a personalized view for the
logged-in user on My Stewardship Dashboard and as a full view under the
Curate menu. The full-view report displays both curation changes and
physical metadata changes using two separate tabs. For more information,

<p>Alation has added the following new features for Custom DB:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Support has been added for extracting function and procedure metadata
for data sources using DB Type <em>Custom DB</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>User can now use Kerberos authentication to connect to a datasource
using DB Type <em>Custom DB</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For a <em>Custom DB</em> datasource, users can select the Disable bulk
extraction checkbox on the Metadata Extraction page to disable
bulk extraction and iterate through tables individually. This should
be used only when bulk extraction fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports Query Log Ingestion (QLI) for table-based custom
data sources. QLI will work only if query log history can be
retrieved using a SQL query.</p></li>

<h4>Catalog Pages<a class="headerlink" href="#catalog-pages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previously, on Home Page, users were able to see all the tiles
regardless of the access permissions for referenced objects. Now,
Alation checks if the current user can see the tile object and
filters out the ones for which they do not have the view permission.</p></li>
<li><p>The Undo and Redo buttons have been added to the text editor to
facilitate editing of articles.</p></li>
<li><p>The rich text custom fields are now sorted alphabetically on the BI
Server, BI Project, and BI Report catalog pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Rich text editors(Articles and Description) now support overflow and

<h4>Data Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#data-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previously, the data source privacy message was available on the
General tab of Data Source Settings. It has been removed from the
General tab. The Access tab of the Data Source Settings now contains
information on the data source privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>The dependency of AWS Glue metastore on Hive as a data source has
been removed. Now, AWS Glue metastore can be added as a data source to
Alation without providing the host/URI details.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports metadata extraction from Data Definition
Language (DDL) statements in Google BigQuery.</p></li>
<li><p>The Open With DataOS integration has been improved to allow third
party applications to request configuration from each user.</p></li>
<li><p>Manual Catalog Sets and children metadata synchronization feature is
now ON by default, for all users. Object Equivalences have been
migrated to be included into Manual Sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the Field tab of the Tableau workbook listed only up to
100 items, though there were more fields. This limit has  been
withdrawn as support for pagination has now been added for measure
and dimension tables of the Fields tab for BI Report, MicroStrategy
Report, Tableau Workbook, and Tableau Sheet catalog pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the metadata of schema, tables, attributes, indexes, primary and
foreign keys were extracted if a data source is added as Custom DB.
Now, if the Custom DB contains procedure/function and the driver
supports it, the corresponding metadata will be extracted.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports Shared Access Signature as a new authentication
type for Azure Blob Store data source.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports extraction for SQL Server Reporting Service
(SSRS) in Sharepoint integrated mode. The version of SSRS support
includes 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2017.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now has functionality to avoid the extraction of extended
information during Query Log Ingestion (QLI) for Teradata. This
significantly saves disk space and allows seamless functioning of
automated QLI. This feature will not affect the default columns that
are already shown on the QLI page.</p></li>
<li><p>Hive QLI now supports richer and more directive error messages
intended to make error identification easier for users.</p></li>
<li><p>Considerably improved stability, speed, and extensibility for QLI on
Hive data sources.</p></li>
<li><p>HDFS/ADLS connectivity issues with regard to incorrect host name,
port and SSL for metadata extraction were previously not logged with
sufficient detail. Now, additional log has been added to capture
information on incorrect host name, port and SSL.</p></li>

<section id="platform">
<h4>Platform<a class="headerlink" href="#platform" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Deprecation flag propagation feature is now hooked to Flag public
APIs. Adding DEPRECATION flags via POST API will propagate flags to
the descendants. Removing DEPRECATION flags via DELETE API will
delete propagated flags from the descendants.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if the user deprecated a data object (Example: Schema S
got a deprecation flag on Alation, and its existing children got a
propagated flag) and a child object is created (Example: Table T
under Schema S) and metadata extraction is run on the data source,
then the table T would not get a propagated flag. This issue is now
resolved because the metadata extraction job finds and adds missing
flags for new objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, flag propagation could be kicked off only from RDBMS
objects (Data Source, Schema, Table). Now it is extended to
BI and File Systems, so that deprecating a BI object or a File
System object will trigger propagation of flags to its descendants
and any objects connected via lineage.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Find Objects by Custom Field API returned all the objects
including the deleted ones. With this fix, it returns only the
non-deleted objects unless the user passes “include_deleted=True”.</p></li>
<li><p>If a user is suspended, a task is triggered that provides Edit access
to the private articles of the suspended user to all admin users.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports loading custom drivers from a directory. So,
if a single driver needs to be loaded from multiple jar files, they
can be placed in a single directory in the custom driver path.</p></li>
<li><p>The alation_conf will now write the PostgresSQL configuration
parameter value in On/Off instead of the true/false boolean value.</p></li>
<li><p>If LDAP is enabled for any user, the DB account and the username
should be the same. However, in the Top Users section on a catalog
page, the Alation users and DB accounts were shown separately. Now,
if LDAP is enabled, in Top Users, the DB accounts are mapped to the
Alation users.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the HTTP REDIRECT binding method was only supported for
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication. Now, the
HTTP REDIRECTandHTTP POSTbinding methods are supported for SAML
authentication</p></li>

<td><p>Fixed an issue where some users
could not log in after update
when using SAML SSO for
authentication.
Alation recently added support
for using HTTP POST binding with
SAML SSO. All customers were
previously using Redirect binding
because Alation did not support
POST binding. Many configurations
allow for automatically selecting
POST binding if available. This
caused existing instances to
switch over and in some cases
caused authentication failures
blocking users from logging in.
Now, Alation has changed SAML SSO
support to always force
defaulting to Redirect binding.
So existing installations
integrated with SAML SSO should
work in the same way they did
before. Those customers wanting
to use POST binding can change
the configuration
<em>alation.authentication.
saml.force_redirect_binding</em>
to <em>False</em>.</p></td>

<h2>RELEASE 5.8.5 - Security Patch<a class="headerlink" href="#release-5-8-5-security-patch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This patch is a critical fix that addresses the security vulnerability
with logging which has been described in the recent Security bulletin:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="summary">
<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist with debugging, the Alation application writes
exceptions to log files. Alation’s codebase includes an open-source
third-party exception-logging library called Raven. We recently
discovered that Raven has an undocumented bug such that it sometimes
logs usernames and passwords stored in the application memory to the
Alation log files in cleartext.</p>
<p>In this patch we completely deactivate Raven.Originally,we included
the Raven capabilities into Alation to have the richest possible logs
for rapid issue resolution. Although without Raven certain issues may be
more difficult to diagnose, we will continue to have other logging
information. There are no plans on adding those exception-logging
capabilities back, presently; we will rely on other kinds of logs and
monitoring for diagnosis of issues.</p>
<p>It is of paramount importance that this security patch is installed by
all customers.</p>
<p>Note that this patch does NOT remove any of the existing logs
from your Alation instance. If you have not purged the existing logs as
part of the security bulletin recommendations, please consider doing so
after you install the patch. For instructions, section IV-B, April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers.</p>
