<h2>RELEASE 5.10.9<a class="headerlink" href="#release-5-10-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This patch delivers the Alation product changes required to complete the migration of the Alation technical support operations to the new platform: Service Cloud.</p>
<p>Alation Zendesk Help Center, which was previously used by the Alation technical support to manage support requests from users, is going to be turned off on July 2, 2020 11:59 pm PST. After this time, if users try to raise a ticket using the Zendesk widget or click on any of the Zendesk Help Center links in Alation, they will receive an error message <strong>until this patch is installed</strong>.</p>
<p>In this patch:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Zendesk Support widget has been removed;</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in links to Zendesk Help Center have been removed;</p></li>
<li><p>The links to the Alation product documentation have been retargeted to the active product documentation site. Docs are available to all Alation users, and no additional configuration is required. See <a class="reference internal" href="#access-alation-product-docs">Access Alation Product Docs</a> below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Designated Service Cloud admin users</strong> have the ability to contact Alation Support directly from Alation if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance. Your organization will inform all Alation users who your designated admins are.</p></li>
<li><p>All users have the ability to access your internal help desk if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an Alation admin, then after this patch is applied, please make sure to perform the additional configuration to display links to the Service Cloud and your internal help desk:</p>

<h4>Snowflake QLI Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#snowflake-qli-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before this update, QLI for Snowflake data sources was performed using
the QUERY_HISTORY table function of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA which is
limited to extracting a maximum of 10,000 query logs for the last seven days
and is further optimized to fetch 10,000 query logs for the last 24
hours. This improvement introduces a new way to perform QLI: it is now
possible to configure QLI to run on the QUERY_HISTORY view of the
ACCOUNT_USAGE schema which does not have this limitation. For more

Starting with V R6, Alation supports column-level lineage enabling you

added ability to capture data flow processes, such as ETL, with the help
of a new type of Alation object: <em>Dataflow object</em>. Generic Dataflow
objects can represent stored procedures, ETL processes or other data
preparation tools. Dataflow objects and column-level lineage data must

<h4>Collaborative Query Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#collaborative-query-writing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Compose users will now have a better experience writing queries with
more improvements to query collaboration.
Query owners will be able to give access to their queries to other users
as Authors. Users will not be able to edit somebody else’s query unless
given access. The users who have been invited to collaborate, will
receive email notifications with the link to the shared query.
Collaborators will also see the queries that they can edit in the Query
Browser under Saved Queries and Shared Queries. Viewers and query
authors can see who is currently collaborating on the query by clicking
the Who can access link in the new Share dialog. Such filters as
Scheduled and Frequency have been added to Advanced Search &gt; Queries.</p>
<p>There are accompanying <a class="reference internal" href="../../../analyst/DevelopQueries/ScheduleQueries.html"><span class="doc">changes to scheduled queries</span></a> : now, a query must be
published before it can be scheduled. During update to V R6, any

<p>Lexicon and Business Glossary are now integrated to provide a way to
link relevant data objects to articles in bulk. The Lexicon job will run
weekly to analyze the names of such catalog objects as Schemas, Tables,
and Columns and put together a list of <a class="reference internal" href="../../../steward/ArticleGroups/WorkwithSuggestedTerms.html"><span class="doc">Suggested Terms</span></a>. Suggested Terms are
candidate glossary terms which Lexicon produces after “scanning” the
names of the schemas, tables, and columns, expanding the abbreviations,
and mapping them onto the titles or auto-titles of these objects.
Suggested Terms and the relevant data objects for these terms can be
accessed by users with the Catalog or Server Admin roles on the
Suggested Terms tab of the Glossaries page. Admin users can add a
Suggested Term to an existing article or as a new article to a glossary.
The links between this term and the relevant data objects as discovered
by Lexicon will be added to a dedicated section Related Data Objects.
Users with any role can view the list of Related Data Objects on the
page of the article as well as a mention of this article under the
Relevant Articles field on the pages of the linked data objects.</p>

<h4>Alation Analytics ETL Performance Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#alation-analytics-etl-performance-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Introduced incremental loading for the logical metadata ETL job as the
initial step in improving performance of the Alation Analytics ETL
process. Previously, this ETL job performed a full replacement of the
data and could take an extremely long time, especially on sizable
datasets. Customers who have database and file system sources in their
Alation catalog but do not have any BI sources may notice that the
Alation Analytics ETL is completed faster than before. However, if your
catalog contains BI sources, you may only notice a slight to no
improvement. This ETL change is the first change in a series of
improvements Alation is planning for Alation Analytics ETL in the coming
releases.</p>

<h4>Encryption Keys Management<a class="headerlink" href="#encryption-keys-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Implemented an additional master encryption key that is used to encrypt

logs are also available for key transactions. The encryption happens
automatically in all new installations of V R6 and when Alation is
updated to V R6 from previous releases. This functionality does not
affect the Alation UI, and no action is required on the users’ part.
This feature has been added to help organizations comply with data
protection regulations without the need for any 3rd-party software.</p>

<li><p>Release  5.10.1  has an issue with metadata extraction from
Tableau sources with permission mirroring enabled when it is taking
too long to complete and when permissions may be applied inaccurately
to objects in Alation. With the “Disable Hard Sync” setting turned
on, it may complete in a shorter time. The fix for the issue is
planned for the next patch release. (This is fixed in release
5.10.2).</p></li>
<li><p>The weekly automatic <em>curation progress resync</em> job and Lexicon job
do not run. Curation Progress report is not affected as this is a
back-up job, and there are other background update jobs that keep the
report data up-to-date. However, the Lexicon job has to be triggered
manually on demand for now for the suggested terms and auto-titles to
be updated. (This is fixed in release 5.10.2).</p></li>

<h3>Known Issues Identified in LA<a class="headerlink" href="#known-issues-identified-in-la" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You may encounter several issues with the Google BigQuery
data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>data uploader and data dictionary upload features are not
available for data sources of this type</p></li>
<li><p>column profile for data type geography will fail with an error</p></li>
<li><p>ALTER TABLE query will result in a null pointer exception in
Compose</p></li>
<li><p>MDE will fail for a dataset with a long name of 1024 characters</p></li>
<li><p>Struct column type will appear as a table in the catalog</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There are currently several issues with Denodo data sources
(added using Custom DB framework):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data Profiling appears to be working but may produce exceptions in
the taskserver.log</p></li>
<li><p>A table or view created using Compose will only be visible in the
catalog after performing MDE.</p></li>
<li><p>Stored Procedures “procedureecho” are not extracted and do not
appear in Alation under Code &gt; Functions.</p></li>
<li><p>For functions and procedures which do not have any schema name
associated with them, Alation creates an internal “global” schema
that will be visible in the catalog. There will also be exceptions
in the taskserver.log</p></li>
<li><p>When running multiple statements in Compose, then in a situation
when the data source is not responding, the correct error message
will only appear for the first statement. The other statement will
throw a “query aborted” message without giving any context for the
error.</p></li>
<li><p>When running the Profiling for the Denodo data source, then in a
situation when the data source is not responding, there will be no
error messages in the catalog UI, and the message in
<em>taskserver.log</em> will just say that the data source is suspended
without providing any more context for the error.</p></li>
<li><p>Selective extraction of schemas is not available for this data
source</p></li>
<li><p>Data dictionary upload is not available for this data source</p></li>
<li><p>During MDE, indexes are not extracted from this data source</p></li>
<li><p>Data uploader is not working with this data source</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Alation may fail to send an email notification to the user about a
new task assignment via an open Conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>A few things not working as expected in Compose:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the Description field of a query is updated in Compose and an
Alation object is &#64;-mentioned in this Description field, then the
reference have the mentioned object type as “undefined” in the
Catalog on the catalog page of the query. This can be seen in the
code view mode of the Description field in the Catalog.</p></li>
<li><p>PUT lock API is triggered again after the first key press which
follows Edit Query or Takeover &amp; Edit button click.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There may be performance issues with downloading the content of the
user’s Inbox where it may take a long time to load or even time
out.</p></li>
<li><p>When authenticated using NTLM, profiling for a SQLServer data
source returns no data for the image  data type.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Output table on the Dataflow object page will display an
empty row for a temporary column if a temporary column is present in
the column-level lineage data.</p></li>
<li><p>The existing upstream and downstream lineage flows are shown on
the lineage diagram only if they are relevant to the data object
selected in the diagram. Note that the selected object is always
indicated with the orange color. When a target data object on a given
diagram was created using several source data objects, then all
of these source data objects will be present in the diagram. However,
not all of the lineage data existing for these source objects may be
relevant to the currently selected object. Such lineage flows -
existing in data, but unrelated to the currently selected object -
will not be displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Updating a complex data type via the noSQL API may not work
correctly when a complex data type is changed to a primitive data
type (for example, when an “Array” is changed to “Integer”).</p></li>
<li><p>Updating the metadata of a virtual data source of the Generic
NoSQL type with the “remove not seen” parameter currently does not
remove the fields of struct type.</p></li>
<li><p>Connection to SQLServer in Compose may fail after running a query
which results in an unsupported data type error.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiling may fail for Hive tables containing
the union  data type.</p></li>
<li><p>For Greenplum data sources, when a user runs a query with filters
and JOINs in Compose, the count of filters and JOINs is not updated
on the  Filter and Joins  tab in the catalog even though the
query history will contains this query.</p></li>
<li><p>MDE may fail for HDInsight when extracting bucketed tables and
the default schema.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently when leaving the “Extract all projects except” default
option for selective extraction from MicroStrategy, users need to
make sure they select the specific projects to exclude and add them
to the list of exceptions. If the projects to be excluded have not
been added, Alation understands this as “exclude all projects”, and
the attempt at MDE will fail with a null pointer error.</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced search export is not available when the Generic BI model
flags are enabled and search results include BI objects.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an issue with the ubervisor.err log file when it is not
rotating and can grow to a very large size.</p></li>
<li><p>It is currently not possible to add a new Databricks data source
as the Add Data Source wizard fails with an error for this database
type.</p></li>
<li><p>For the Presto data source type, when you try to open the data
source catalog page clicking on the Open Page button on the upper
left of the page at Sources Manage Settings / &lt;Data Source
Name&gt; on the Settings page, the catalog page will not open due
to a JS error on the page. For now, you can open the catalog page of
Presto sources from the Sources page (accessible from the main
toolbar) or by finding it in search and clicking its title.</p></li>
