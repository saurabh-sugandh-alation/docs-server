<p>This patch delivers the Alation product changes required to complete the migration of the Alation technical support operations to the new platform: Service Cloud.</p>
<p>Alation Zendesk Help Center, which was previously used by the Alation technical support to manage support requests from users, is going to be turned off on July 2, 2020 11:59 pm PST. After this time, if users try to raise a ticket using the Zendesk widget or click on any of the Zendesk Help Center links in Alation, they will receive an error message <strong>until this patch is installed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In this patch</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Zendesk Support widget has been removed;</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in links to Zendesk Help Center have been removed;</p></li>
<li><p>The links to the Alation product documentation have been retargeted to the active product documentation site. Docs are available to all Alation users, and no additional configuration is required. See <a class="reference internal" href="#access-alation-product-docs">Access Alation Product Docs</a> below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Designated Service Cloud admin users</strong> have the ability to contact Alation Support directly from Alation if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance. Your organization will inform all Alation users who your designated admins are.</p></li>
<li><p>All users have the ability to access your internal help desk if this is additionally configured on the Alation instance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an Alation admin, then after this patch is applied, please make sure to perform the additional configuration to display links to the Service Cloud and your internal help desk:</p>

<td><p>This improvement allows for importing
Compose query result sets into MS Excel
while keeping the correct values for the
text-like data types when values contain
leading zeros. You can now enable
pre-formatting for such data types, which
consists in wrapping the values in
additional quote marks in the files formed
by Alation. This helps avoid additional
formatting of the data sets before importing
query result sets into MS Excel. For details, see

<h3>Known Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Release 5.9.9 continues to have an issue with metadata extraction
from Tableau sources with permission mirroring enabled when it is taking
too long to complete and when permissions may be applied inaccurately to
objects in Alation. Previously, extraction from Tableau with permission
mirroring enabled would stall indefinitely or fail with errors in logs.
In 5.9.9, we changed the approach to permission validation and to
saving permission information so that Alation can process larger volumes
of data.  Now, extraction from Tableau with permission mirroring enabled
will be completed successfully but may still take a very long time. With
the “Disable Hard Sync” setting turned on, it may complete in a shorter
time.</p>
<p>The fix for the issue is planned for the next patch release.</p>

<h4>Configuration-Based Hive Extraction<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-based-hive-extraction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this release, Alation is taking a new approach to Hive data sources:
they can now be added to the catalog by uploading the Hive configuration
files instead of providing the configuration parameters manually. This
change enables Alation to extend the support of automatic metadata
extraction and query log ingestion to numerous Hive configurations. It
also reduces the configuration effort on the user’s side. This feature
can be turned on in Labs. Note that enabling this functionality will not
migrate existing Hive sources: this must be done on a per-data source
basis. See the Hive 2 section in <a class="reference internal" href="../../../datasources/AddDataSources/index.html"><span class="doc">Adding Data Sources</span></a> for details.</p>

<section id="generic-bi-model-for-tableau-server-sources">
<h4>Generic BI Model for Tableau Server Sources<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-bi-model-for-tableau-server-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Tableau Server sources in Alation move to the Generic BI Model. For
Tableau sources, it means more features and a better catalog user
experience. Transitioning to this model, Tableau sources receive a
remake of the catalog pages, a more straightforward configuration flow,
a few additional parameters in Settings, and the ability to apply
permissions to logical metadata (titles, tags, descriptions, and custom
fields) that was not available in previous releases. The new Generic
framework for Tableau can be enabled by setting a feature flag. When
enabled, it will work for all new Tableau sources that you add to the
catalog. Note that the existing Tableau sources remain intact and fully
functional as Alation continues to support the older Tableau integration
framework; however, you can choose to migrate your Tableau sources to
the new model. You can refer to  <a class="reference internal" href="../../../bisources/WorkwithBISources/CatalogPagesOverviewforGenericBIModelTableauSources.html"><span class="doc">Overview of Catalog Pages for Tableau Sources on Generic BI Model</span></a>  and

data sources, providing capabilities for scaling to accommodate large
data sets and enhancing the server performance in this area. Moreover,
Alation now supports Virtual Data Sources (VDS) for NoSQL databases.
Although there is no automated metadata extraction for VDS, you can use

<section id="hive-structs-representation">
<h4>Hive Structs Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#hive-structs-representation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Catalog representation of the <em>struct</em> data type for Hive has been
improved to fully show the struct composition. In Alation, the data type
for a column is usually indicated under the Properties section on
the right of the catalog page; but with structs, which tend to be long
and dense, the data type indicated in this way was often contracted and
difficult to read. This enhancement associates the columns of struct
data type with a new catalog page template <em>NoSQL Attribute</em>, which
makes it possible to reveal the struct composition as a tree table. For
more clarity, the path from the parent column to a specific struct
component will appear in a hover-over tooltip. Each struct component has
its own catalog page with breadcrumbs that reveal the full path from the
parent schema to this object.
Note that this Hive struct representation is not supported for Virtual
Data Sources. See <a class="reference internal" href="../../../sources/WorkwithCatalogData/StructDataTypeinHiveDataSources.html"><span class="doc">Struct Data Type in Hive Data Sources</span></a> for more details.</p>

dedicated catalog page - accessible from the main toolbar - where you
can find all existing glossaries and create a new one. There is now a
more consistent flow of actions that makes glossaries simple to use.
Articles can be added to or removed from glossaries both on the Article

the roles of <em>Catalog</em> or <em>Server Admins</em>; however, all users can find

<h4>Improvements to Query Version History<a class="headerlink" href="#improvements-to-query-version-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This release includes several improvements to Query Version History.
Now, if Query Version History is enabled in your Alation instance, all
edits to queries are saved automatically. In Version History, query
authors can see all unpublished edits in addition to the main versions
created at the time of publishing. All users (authors and non-authors)
can now compare query versions and view the differences highlighted with
color. For details, refer to  <a class="reference internal" href="../../../analyst/DevelopQueries/SaveQueriesandTypesofQueryVersions.html"><span class="doc">Saving Queries and Types of Query Versions</span></a>  and  <a class="reference internal" href="../../../analyst/DevelopQueries/CompareVersionsinQueryVersionHistory.html"><span class="doc">Comparing Versions in Query Version History</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Save As button in Compose has been renamed to Clone,
although the functionality of <em>Save As</em> remains as before.
See  <a class="reference internal" href="../../../analyst/DevelopQueries/CloneQueries.html"><span class="doc">Cloning Queries</span></a>  for
details.</p>
<p>Starting with this release, you can only schedule
a published query. The Schedule button will only be enabled
for queries which have been published.</p>

<h3>Configurable Query Result Size<a class="headerlink" href="#configurable-query-result-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The result table size for queries executed in Compose is now
configurable. There is a new parameter on the Compose Settings tab of
Admin Settings that can be used to set a new result size limit. Alation
recommends you assess the available resources on your instance before
changing the result size to more than 70 MB: 60 GB or more of RAM of
free space is recommended for stable performance. For details,

<section id="standardized-log-rotation">
<h4>Standardized Log Rotation<a class="headerlink" href="#standardized-log-rotation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We have changed the log rotation mechanism to unify the rotation for all
types of logs at /opt/alation/site/logs. Now, all logs will rotate
based on the same rotation rule: at the end of the day, the current log
is “retired” and marked with a date, and a new log of the same type is
created for new entries. Alation has a cap on the number of rotated logs
of one type. When the limit is hit, the old logs are cleaned-up.</p>
</section>
<section id="logging-tab">
<h4>Logging Tab<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-tab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sending encrypted logs to Alation has received a remake and a better,
friendlier interface. Now, you can collect logs to send to Alation on
the dedicated Logging tab in Admin Settings. You can retrieve a list
of log files for a time period that you define and then select specific
logs to be packaged. Alation will also estimate the size of the selected
logs as a heads-up for the log package size. For details, see <a class="reference internal" href="../../../admins/AdminSettings/SendEncryptedLogs.html"><span class="doc">Sending Encrypted Logs to Alation</span></a>.
Standardized Timezone Use For Several Log Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>Timezone use in Taskserver, Connector, and Celery logs has been
standardized to utilize the UTC time format. Other types of logs will be
addressed in future releases.</p>

<section id="mongodb-component-removed">
<h4>MongoDB Component Removed<a class="headerlink" href="#mongodb-component-removed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In prior releases, Alation used MongoDB as an internal component for
storing Alation server data, such as, for example, the results of
Compose queries. Since version V R2 (5.4.x), Alation has begun to
migrate off MongoDB to the PostgreSQL database. This transition has been
happening in the background and is complete in the current release. In V
R5, the MongoDB component has been entirely removed from the Alation
package.</p>

<section id="alation-server-health-alerts-for-admins">
<h4>Alation Server Health Alerts for Admins<a class="headerlink" href="#alation-server-health-alerts-for-admins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You can now configure your Alation instance to run Alation server health
checks which will alert the admins in case of any server-side health
issues. These checks go beyond the basic system checks such as CPU load
or RAM usage which are usually monitored by the customers’ own system
monitoring utilities. The Alation server health checks provide the
Alation-specific details that can be essential in assessing the
stability of the instance. This functionality complements the component
status checks in Monitor section of Admin Settings but does not yet have
a UI. For more details, see <a class="reference internal" href="../../../admins/Troubleshooting/ConfigureServerHealthAlertsforAdmins.html"><span class="doc">Configuring Alation Server Health Alerts for Admins</span></a>.</p>

<section id="enhanced-search-queues">
<h4>Enhanced Search Queues<a class="headerlink" href="#enhanced-search-queues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Search indexing has been improved to handle job crashes so that items in
the search queue are not lost. All the items to be indexed are retried
after the background job resumes. User-made changes have higher priority
to be indexed over the items that were updated though a bulk process
like metadata extraction (MDE). As a result, even if there are millions
of items to be indexed because of MDE, any title/description updates
will be reflected in search almost instantly.</p>

<section id="deprecation-of-update-mention-jobs">
<h4>Deprecation of Update Mention Jobs<a class="headerlink" href="#deprecation-of-update-mention-jobs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To avoid potential overload of Celery queues when a large
amount of catalog data is loaded via the public API, we
have deprecated the background Celery tasks which were
previously used to update the titles of objects mentioned
in custom fields. Before this change, the titles of
mentioned objects were stored as part of the reference.
The more references had to be updated, the larger number
of corresponding Celery jobs would be triggered, which
could cause the Celery queue to overload and stall.</p>
<p>In V R5, we have changed the way mentioned objects are
stored. Now, Alation only stores a reference of the
mentioned object, and the backend API will fetch the
current title whenever this object is displayed in the
UI. This allows us to keep the Celery queue healthy when
a large number of object mentions has to be updated.

<li><p>The SQL view in the catalog was displaying a truncated view for big
queries, only showing up to 100 rows. Now the SQL view supports a
full view of large queries.</p></li>
<li><p>We added ability to search for objects by title that is a shared
field propagated from a catalog set. However, updates to shared
titles are not immediately reflected in search. There is a delay (10
minutes maximum) after the shared field was added/changed via a
catalog set and before the object can appear in search. This time is
required for search re-indexing as changes through catalog sets can
impact millions of objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, execution results of queries scheduled in Compose were
displayed in the catalog as untitled results followed by the query
ID: <em>Untitled Result [ID]</em>. This did not provide a good user
experience as the results were hard to locate and differentiate and
had to be renamed manually. Now, scheduled query results will have a

<li><p>Previously, the batch_size parameter was hard-coded as <em>10,000</em>
for the curation progress computation job. This configuration was
memory-intensive and could cause PostgreSQL service to fail when the
Alation server was low on memory. This parameter is now configurable
via alation_conf: <a class="reference internal" href="../../../admins/AdditionalConfiguration/SetStewardshipParameter.html"><span class="doc">Set stewardship.curation_progress.ingestion.batch_size Parameter</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>Added the <em>htop</em> process viewer to Alation package to facilitate the
debugging of client issues for Alation system admins. Htop is a free
text-mode application for server performance profiling that can be
used to view, monitor, and assess the health of Alation server load,
process tree, memory usage, and CPU core usage via a fast,
interactive, and admin-friendly interface. Htop is accessible from
the Alation shell with the htop command. For details, please
<a class="reference external" href="https://hisham.hm/htop/index.php">visit the htop site.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports re-mounting of the backup volume. A script has
