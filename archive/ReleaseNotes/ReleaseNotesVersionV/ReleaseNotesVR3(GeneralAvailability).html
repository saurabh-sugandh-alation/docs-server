<section id="new-features">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alation was susceptible to outage when the services that connect to
data sources hit memory limits in the Alation code itself or in third
party driver code. Now, Alation can detect when such an issue occurs
and automatically recover. For customers with a DataDog dashboard,
the dashboard now tracks these failures and recoveries.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports pre-formatted block device mount support where
bind mounting is infeasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation Analytics (Beta) is a new analytical service that provides
complete set of usage data for customers to measure the success and
increase adoption of the data catalog. Customers can query usage
information and the metadata cataloged in Alation. They can create
their own reports, measure completion of stewardship programs and
create gamification systems to encourage contribution to the catalog.
The Alation Analytics feature flag must be turned on for the feature
to function.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom fields on Datasource, Schema, and Attribute will show the
change history. A clock icon has been added to each field that will
take you to the change history which includes time, contents and
author for each change. Note: 1. Detailed history will only be
tracked until after the upgrade to this release, any changes before
this release are not recorded. There will be one item in the history
to indicate the state of the field at the time of the upgrade. 2.
Tags and Flags are not included in this change. Only custom fields
will show history.</p></li>
<li><p>New facets to Advanced Search to filter by objects that have a
specific tag or flag have been added. There will now be two new
facets, “Tagged With” and “Flag Types”. These will appear after you
have already chosen an object type to filter by and only if at least
one of the results of your search have a tag or flag. The “Tagged
With” facet will show a list of tags and choosing one will filter to
only the objects that have that tag applied. The “Flag Types” facet
will show a list of flag types (endorsement, warning, deprecation)
and choosing one of those will filter to only objects that have at
least one flag of that type. Existing objects that were tagged or
flagged will be re-indexed before they are available in these new
facets. This should happen automatically very shortly after the
upgrade to VR3+.</p></li>
<li><p>Stewardship dashboard (beta) lets stewards see how well their area is
curated and helps them prioritize the curation effort. Alation also
introduce Curation Progress as a measure of how well a data object
(schema, table, column) is documented/curated. The first version of
the stewardship dashboard has two reports:
- Curation progress report: Summary of how well the area is curated
and also a way to prioritize the documentation effort based on
popularity/usage of data objects (schema, tables, and columns)
- Objects without stewards report: List of data objects that do not
have stewards assigned, prioritized based on popularity/usage
information and curation progress.</p></li>

<h2>Admin Release Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#admin-release-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<section id="id1">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new home page is available in Labs which provides quick links for
common actions in the catalog, plus configurable sections for links
to articles, tags, business intelligence reports, or searches. Please
contact your Alation Customer Service Manager or Sales Engineer to
help you configure this new home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto-titling algorithm can now be “taught” from users adding or
updating titles on catalog pages. Those user-added titles are
considered as feedback for the auto-titling algorithm in addition to
all the ways to “teach” it that existed before: feedback from
terms/titles added on the Lexicon page and frequency and patterns of
words seen in the catalog. This feature is currently behind
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enable_lexicon_user_feedback</span></code> feature flag in
alation_conf.</p></li>
<li><p>The catalog administrator can now manually trigger the Lexicon job to
re-compute the auto-title guesses from the UI and can monitor the
status of the job. This can be accessed by clicking the Settings
link on the Lexicon page.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports new user role: Catalog Admin and has access to
general Alation catalog setup and customization, which includes the
following:
- Manage custom fields &amp; custom templates
- Manage field level view and edit permissions on catalog pages
- Create and manage catalog sets
- Manage and update lexicon
- Manage glossaries
The Admin user role is renamed to Server Admin. Server administrators
have full access, including Alation configuration (Example: User
management, authentication, and server monitoring).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previously, when you share articles and execution results with
non-alation users, email was sent in plain text format. Now, email is
sent as an Alation template. The layout of email notification for
sharing both articles and Compose results has also been improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Users will now be notified by email if they are added or removed as a
data source administrator for a data source.</p></li>
<li><p>For Alation administrator accounts, Tableau permission mirroring is
applied to ensure that the administrator will only be able to see the
to see Tableau reports/workbooks/data sources in Alation for which
they have access.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation can now run on AWS Linux 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The dockerized Alation installation streams upgrade messages to
installer.log.</p></li>
<li><p>SmartSuggest offers more than just auto-completion, it also
proactively suggests SQL snippets based on usage patterns on your
data. Previously, this caused users to accidentally insert
suggestions when trying to insert a newline or tab. Now, the
interaction is improved to avoid those accidental insertions. We hope
this tweak will bring you the best of both worlds: proactive
suggestions that will only be inserted when you want them.
Note: You may have disabled “Eager Suggest” in Compose settings
previously to avoid this problem. If you did, we recommend you to
enable them again to see if you like it better. Let us know!</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Field Value Format page will no longer have three sections
explaining format for three different APIs (Articles API, Find
Objects by Custom Field API, Upload Logical Metadata API). Now, each
of the API will have a separate page that explains the custom field
format for that respective API. This new page can be accessed by
clicking the custom field format links on each of the API
documentation page.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload logical metadata API can now be used to update custom field
values for API Resources and API Resource Fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation supports cataloging Databricks instances (version 4.6), which
complies with the Apache Spark standard. Users will be able to add
Databricks to alation, extract metadata, run queries on the
Databricks cluster, sample data from Databricks. Alation also
supports Lineage and Popularity by parsing and ingesting the
Databricks query logs stored in Amazon S3.</p></li>
<li><p>iotop utility has been added to Alation. System administrators can
now monitor disk I/O by process and print summary reports using this
tool.</p></li>
<li><p>New option is added to disable permission enforcement from the
settings page of Tableau Server.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tableau workbooks can now be sorted by popularity on the catalog
page. Sorting by popularity is set as a default option.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the object equivalence page used to take 50 seconds to
load. The page load time for object equivalence under admin settings
has been improved and it now takes only three seconds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alation ensures that the backup folder exists before running backup.
If the backup folder does not exist, Alation creates a new folder for
backup. Alation updates the existing backup folder with the
timestamp.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the query search page can execute the user-uploaded
Javascript. Now, the script has enhanced security and the query
search page will never execute the user-loaded Javascript.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation now supports Hive servers configured with Kerberos and HTTP
transport mode. Previously, compose and profiling would fail when
attempting to run them on Hive data sources in this configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Users previously were unable to create Python UDFs in Compose because
the white space between new lines for a single statement was not
preserved. Compose has now been updated to preserve the formatting
of the entire statement when query is sent to the database and
properly interpret UDFs of languages that care about whitespace
formatting.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, large articles on the ‘Getting started for analyst’ used
to overflow the container for Internet Explorer 10. This issue has
been resolved and the content now appears inside the container.</p></li>
<li><p>When hovering over a TrustCheck highlight in Compose, you can now see
if it was added by a catalog set.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when you add Sybase ASE as a data source, Kerberos
connectivity was provided as a config option. Sybase ASE does not
support Kerberos connectivity and the option has been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Facet selection search has been improved to display valid results.</p></li>
<li><p>Use TLS parameter can now be configured from the Admin Settings &gt;
Email Server screen (Email Notification section). Previously, the
Test &amp; Save button would not properly pass the Use TLS parameter. If
the test failed, it would not save the parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata extraction was failing for Greenplum due to a filter value
in the metadata extraction query. To resolve this issue, the pattern
to exclude the system schema has been corrected to ensure that user
schema names with prefix “pg” do not get excluded during metadata
extraction.</p></li>
<li><p>On the General Settings tab of the data source settings page, you can
select which JDBC driver to use to connect to the data source.
Previously, the end of the driver name was not seen because they were
cut off. This made it impossible to pick the correct driver when two
drivers have nearly the same name, but a different suffix without
guessing and checking. Now, the dropdown selector should expand to
show the full name for all the builtin drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>“SELECT INTO” statements written using SQL Server are now correctly
categorized as CREATE statements. So, the following features will
work correctly:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Table level lineage from source to target table.</p></li>
<li><p>The target table inside the SELECT INTO statement will immediately appear on the catalog page.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Previously, the insert date button would not bring up the calendar
popover to insert a date in Compose desktop. Now, the insert date
button works properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Article title containing unicode characters caused a 500
error. Article titles can now contain unicode characters.</p></li>
<li><p>In 5.3.0, a bug was introduced that prevented users from being able
to form new database connections from the query form screen. Now,
users can connect properly from any query form.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-picker field values on an article page were replaced with other
picker/multi-picker field values when the ‘Show Empty Fields’ button
was used. The fix now shows correct values for all multi-picker
fields when the ‘Show Empty Fields’ button is used on an article
page.</p></li>
<li><p>ArrayIndexOutofBounds exception error occurred when the number of
reports to be fetched was set to zero under Extraction Settings in
MicroStrategy. This has been resolved and the user now needs to set
the number of reports greater than zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the Query search and Compose pages would fail to load in
Safari private browsing mode due to a dependency on local storage
browser feature support. Now, these pages load in Safari private
browsing mode.</p></li>
<li><p>TrustCheck markers now update properly when commenting and
uncommenting blocks of code with the comment shortcut.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, resolution of partially qualified tables was failing for
Query Log ingestion of Google BigQuery. Now, Alation can resolve
partially qualified Table name that appear in queries collected from
query log ingestion. The queries will appear in the tables’ query
history.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if a user deprecates an object, and then un-deprecates
it, it is possible that the job to remove propagated flags completes
before the job to propagate flags to descendants, causing propagated
flags to persist. This issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>The Job Detail parameter in the job status dropdown on the
sources/manage_settings page now shows the updated job state message.
Previously, if a job failed, the job detail parameter would still
show an outdated job running state.</p></li>
<li><p>For certain database types (Sybase ASE), analysis of the view
definition could cause self loop in the lineage graph. This issue has
been fixed where the view name was interpreted as a source table.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the time for scheduled queries always displayed the
Pacific Time in Query Search. Now, the time displays the browser’s
time zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, a 500 error would occur when you visit a deleted Catalog
set page. This issue has been resolved. Now, 404 error occurs when
you visit a deleted Catalog set page.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, an error message ” Value is too long for character type”
occurred in metadata extraction when the table name was greater than
1000 characters. This has been resolved. Alation can now ingest
tables that have names bigger than 1000 characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Query aborted error occurred when user-defined column
type queries were run in Compose for Oracle data source. This has
been resolved. Queries can now be run for user-defined column type
for Oracle data source.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the CHECK partition index was not getting ingested during
metadata extraction for Teradata and the Query log ingestion was
unable to parse it. This issue has been resolved. Alation parses the
CHECK constraint now.</p></li>
<li><p>The version of the Data Source API in Alation V R2 omitted a field
necessary to set up a data source with scheduled metadata extraction.
Now the disable_auto_extraction field can be set to false to make
extraction run.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Query aborted error occurred due to long insert SQL
statement. This has been resolved and Alation recommends the length
of the SQL statements to be less than 100k characters. Alation will
not analyze SQL query larger than 100k characters to protect the Java
process against out of memory situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the column order was not preserved when profiling was
carried out for Teradata. This has now been resolved. Now, on the
‘Samples’ tab of a table catalog page, the columns will appear in the
order as they appear in the table definition.</p></li>
<li><p>When article was referenced (added as a custom field value) from
other catalog pages, the article page load was extremely slow,
sometimes causing a timeout. After this fix, articles that are
referenced will load properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the “include” or “exclude” path could be incorrectly
removed when it was edited for HDFS Filesystem. This issue has been
resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Inviting users to conversations about articles no longer throws 500
error.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversation sidebar closes when navigating to catalog pages that do
not support conversations, as opposed to being stuck in an open state
with no content.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, partitions were showing up as separate tables when
metadata was extracted for Greenplum. This issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if there are more than 100 catalog sets, only the first
100 catalog sets were shown on the Catalog sets page. This issue has
been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, ‘select all’ on a multi-picker field will select all the
filtered options if any filter is on. When the multi-picker dropdown
is closed, the filter clears.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, long source comments wrap inside the bounding box, instead of
extending over.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the action of removing server admin themselves from the
server admin group was not disabled in the UI of group object page.
The group object page used the old object list component. Now, the
Server admin cannot remove themselves from the server admin group.
The old object list component has been replaced with new group member
list component and is used in the groups page.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Labs tab of the admin settings, the label text appeared to be
clickable, but it was not. Now, the style of the cursor when hovering
over the label text indicates that it is not clickable.</p></li>
<li><p>The appearance of search results when searching for a filter value in
Advanced Search has been improved. Previously, the results were
spaced badly with large white space making them hard to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, incremental metadata extraction(MDE) triggered from the
insertion failed for a Kerberized impala data source. Incremental MDE
now works as expected for the Kerberized Impala data source.</p></li>
<li><p>An issue in ingesting psql metadata was causing most column types to
be displayed as N/A for Greenplum data source. This also caused
failure in uploading data to table from Alation. This has been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Warnings upon query execution due to mandated filters and/or joins
will now be generated dynamically to include mentions of either
filters or joins depending on which are actually mandated.
Previously, only the word “filters” was used even when joins were
mandated, leading to confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling information in query search results no longer incorrectly
show the last run as having been successful following a schedule
modification made since the last attempted scheduled run which
actually had failed validation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Alation-setup tool provided via pip now provides more helpful and
descriptive error messages and hints. This also ensures that the
Alation query API python client now works on Python 2.6.</p></li>
<li><p>On running extraction for Cognos BI, some folders were not getting
extracted previously. This issue is resolved and now all the
folders/projects will appear on running extraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when the user had loaded a very long query into compose,
upon returning to the home page, the compose query preview section
would slow down drastically depending on how large the query was.
This slow-down would affect the entire page and render the home-page
unusable if the query was too big. Now, the query content becomes
truncated in the preview window, cutting off at 5000 characters, at
which point the user may simply click the window to open up the
compose page to view the full contents.</p></li>
<li><p>ADLS metadata extraction was failing due to authentication type
getting set to default (kerberos) on saving connection parameters.
This issue has been resolved by adding an extra check to ensure
authentication type is not updated on saving connection parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Teradata datatype issue has been fixed. Previously, all datatypes
except char and varchar were not displayed properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, there are issues if a report contains more then one
required prompt in Microstrategy, then, metadata cannot be extracted.
This issue has been resolved and now, we are able to extract the
metadata for these reports as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the connection timeout was 18000000 ms for Google Big
Query and caused the code to keep running even if the connection was
not formed. This made it difficult to locate the error. Now, if the
connection takes more than 60 seconds to form, then, it will time out
and connection will fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the test connection failed and metadata extraction failed
when Salesforce was added as a data source. This issue has been
resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>The Report link is now configurable when you extract reports in
Microstrategy. The customer can provide the web server or load
balancer name for the report URL re-direction. If the name is not
provided, then, the default value (URI) specified in the URL is
picked up. Alation now supports Java-based server for report URL.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the column datatype size was missing for tables created
in Compose for Sybase ASE. This issue has been resolved and the
column datatype size is now displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, indexes were not getting extracted for DB2 zOS
datasource. This is resolved and now metadata extraction of schema
can be done on the Settings page and indexes will also be extracted.</p></li>
<li><p>Deprecation propagation was re-enabled with v4.17. Before v4.17,
there was a feature flag and only if it was turned on, the user can
see propagated deprecation flags. In versions greater than 4.17, the
feature flag itself was removed, and the flag propagation works
automatically. A possible confusion that can happen is, if there are
deprecation flags created before the update, their children will not
have propagated flags, whereas new deprecation flags added after the
update will get propagated to children. A migration has been added
that propagates flags from those objects deprecated before Flag
propagation feature was re-enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Generic BI system, a unified framework to accommodate various BI
server types, was built for v4.18 to enrich physical metadata
extraction and to provide the Alation rich curating capabilities to BI
sources. This has been hidden behind a feature flag, but now the flag
is turned on by default, so that any new imported BI server of a
supported type will use Generic BI system.To
check if Microstrategy is supported by Generic BI system, check the
one of the following URLs,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>old Microstrategy url: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;your</span> <span class="pre">home&gt;/bi/microstrategy/&lt;server_id&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>new Microstrategy url: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;your</span> <span class="pre">home&gt;/bi/gbm/server/&lt;server_id&gt;</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This change is not applied to Tableau.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alation has migrated datasource to LMS and datasource uses Mark as
star value. To get the correct star value, is_faved_by method is
replaced with Mark.is_marked method.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, there was no space between Cancel and Save buttons to
differentiate them as different buttons for custom fields in
Articles. This issue has been resolved. Now, there is a space to
differentiate between the Cancel and Save button.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, expressions were not shown for reports extracted using
Microstrategy. With this fix, the customer will be able to see the
expressions for all the report measures.</p></li>
<li><p>For DB2, the columns were not displayed for tables created using
Compose. This issue has been resolved. However, there is a
limitation. The quoted schema or tables created using compose does
not work.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the measure and dimension was not getting displayed for
reports extracted using Microstrategy. This issue has been resolved.
Now, the user will be able to see all the available measures of
object prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Data source cannot restore deleted data source on the data source
settings page. Alation has now enabled Add/Remove/Update members
action on deleted data source settings page and added some notice to
let administrators know how to manage deleted data sources. The Data
source administrator is able to restore deleted data source on the
general settings page now.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, some invalid SQL could cause Trust Check to show flags
for a column in a different table than the one mentioned in the
query. Now, when a column is used that does not appear in any
mentioned tables, Trust Check will ignore it.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the glossary titles were truncated to a maximum of 20
characters in the Glossary drop-down. This is changed and now the
drop-down expands according to the length of the title.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, the Completed Tasks tab of the Monitor page would not
load for some instances of Alation. This could happen when a task
name was missing. Now, even if a task name is missing, the UI will
load and show the task name as ‘unknown’.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the filter on Sites/Projects in Tableau Extraction
would disappear.</p></li>
<li><p>While Alation administrator upgrades Alation or restore from backup,
post version 5.3.0, users at times would see “unexpected EOF …”
errors in the `installer.log`. These false positive errors would no
longer be appearing in the log files.</p></li>
<li><p>Users of Google BigQuery can run long queries (up to five hours runtime)
through Compose without timeout issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The style of dropdown with filtered search result in advanced search
has been changed now. Previously, results were spaced badly between
the result title and subtext. The space has been rearranged and the
search result looks better now.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the auto-title was not displayed when clearing the
existing title on a schema, table, or column.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if one drags and drops a file into an article while
editing it, it was temporarily saved in a storage outside of Alation.
Now these files are stored inside Alation. It is allowed to drag and
drop files not larger than ALATION_MAX_UPLOADED_ATTACHMENT_FILE_BYTES
size. This limitation is enforced now for images inserted into an
article using corresponding widget.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, there was a possibility that the job to propagate
deprecation flags from the parent object to descendants crashes if a
Compose query mentions the parent object, but such a mention is not
correctly registered. This issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when asked to title an object in Compose in the Dusk
theme on Internet Explorer, the text in the text box was not visible.
Now, it is visible.</p></li>
<li><p>Qubole and Teradata JDBC URI are different from the standard JDBC URI
format dbtype://hostname:port/. From this release, you will be able
to add Qubole and Teradata through CustomDB in Alation.</p></li>
<li><p>User defined column types can now be viewed in Compose for Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when you update an article with the bulk_metadata API,
its “last_updated” would not change. This is fixed so that any change
in the article’s title or description/body using the bulk_metadata
API would update its last_updated field.</p></li>
<li><p>The network connection check on the Tableau settings page has been
resolved. For instance, if the URI uses HTTPS protocol, then the test
checks against port 443.</p></li>
<li><p>“Refresh feature labs page after the requests of changing
alation_conf value finished, but some flags’ value are not updated
correctly because the auto reload conf interval in Alation is 60
seconds. To get the latest conf value, reload all conf since the conf
value might get updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, sorting worked only on title column in Glossaries. Now,
sorting is applied to all the columns in the glossary, ordered from
left to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Users will get `Permission Denied` warning while editing
title/description on object catalog pages, if their permissions are
revoked by admin at the same time. For updating title/description
fields on object catalog pages, the “Edit”” button is deactivated for
users not having edit permissions. So if the admin revokes permission
of any user and that user does not refresh the object catalog page,
they would still be able to edit the field. From now on, they would
get `Permission Denied` warning instead.”</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Tableau workbook pagination used to break on servers
behind improperly configured load balancers. Now, it should correctly
paginate.</p></li>
<li><p>In version 5.5.0, a new bug is introduced causing Alation Analytics
feature’s database setup failure. This bug has been resolved and the
database should now be available as soon as the labs flag is turned
on.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, public datasource browsing API (catalog API) returned
tables/schemas/columns from deleted datasources in the API response.
Datasource browsing API will no longer return objects from deleted
datasources.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, Data Source Settings Per-Object Parameters checkboxes
were clickable even when changes were not yet saved. Now, checkboxes
are disabled when changes to Per-Object Parameters are pending.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, for certain types of objects (schema, table, filesystem,
BI objects), saving a large text (longer than 2000 chars) to a Rich
Text type custom field, either from UI or from API, could have caused
500 error. This has now been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Error reporting for clicking Test and Save Email server settings has
been improved. Previously, the Email server page would not load.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when a Data dictionary gets uploaded and an unexpected
network error occurred, the user would see a blank green text box.
This has been resolved. Now, a proper text message appears and asks
the user to retry when the upload of Data dictionary is not
successful.</p></li>
<li><p>In version before 5.4.5, profiling failed for Azure Data Warehouse.
This has been resolved in version 5.4.5. Profiling is now supported
for Azure Data Warehouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, (versions before 5.4.5), the column profiling failed
for SAS causing a null pointer exception to occur. This issue has
been resolved in version 5.4.5 of Alation and the user can now
successfully profile individual columns for SAS.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if you hit the next button on a page-able list of data
and the request failed for some reason, you would not get any
indication of the failure. Now, a message will pop up letting you
know what went wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Query Log ingestion (QLI) settings page of Presto, auto
ingestion allows daily/weekly/monthly scheduling. Since Presto QLI
reads from a cache that can be overwritten with a short life time,
these options could be too coarse. So, Alation has changed this to
hourly and daily scheduling.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, ‘Presto on Hive’ data source threw an error when query
was executed that requested a Decimal type column. Users can now
profile and query for columns that are Decimal type.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, when null values were present in a table and table
profiling was performed, the null value distribution was not
displayed on the table catalog page and column catalog page. This
issue has been resolved and the null values are now displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, if a customer upgrades from earlier versions of Alation
or v5.2 to v5.4.6 and higher versions, and has added a rich_text type
custom field to the table and the length of the text exceeds 3000
characters, then, the upgrade would fail. This has been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, compose stopped functioning when the result had more than
1000 columns. This has been resolved. Now, the query results that
have more than 50 columns in compose make use of column pagination.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SmartSuggest does not work for Databricks, since it is based on
CustomDB.</p></li>
<li><p>Invalid SessionHandle errors occurs intermittently when Compose is
run for Databricks.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload Data does not work for PostgresSQL and Databricks.</p></li>
<li><p>Column id# is displayed as ‘0’ for all columns for Hive AWS Glue.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation migration will fail when there are huge amounts of objects in
object equivalence.</p></li>
<li><p>After upgrading to Alation v5.4.6 and navigating to the Sources tab,
the following error message ” There was an error connecting to the
server” occurs and connection to the data sources will fail.</p></li>

<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In version 5.6.0, a search on the Query Search page that would return

<li><p>Previously, there was a persistent XSS attack on the user profile
page. This allowed a user with a valid Alation account to execute
JavaScript in the browser of another Alation user. Any user with an
Alation account could create an article and put a script tag in the
title of that article. Anyone who browses to the user’s profile page

<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Alation backend database has a default limit of 1G characters on
the length of SQL query that can be run. Previously, the Metadata
Extraction job used a single INSERT query which could grow over this
limit and cause the job to crash. This issue has now been resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Alation V R3 backup process did not respect the retention
configuration settings. As a result, the backup disk might run out of
space due to the large size of backup archive. This issue is now
resolved.</p></li>

<td><p>Fixed an issue where some users
could not log in after update
when using SAML SSO for
authentication.
Alation recently added support
for using HTTP POST binding with
SAML SSO. All customers were
previously using Redirect binding
because Alation did not support
POST binding. Many configurations
allow for automatically selecting
POST binding if available. This
caused existing instances to
switch over and in some cases
caused authentication failures
blocking users from logging in.
Now, Alation has changed SAML SSO
support to always force
defaulting to Redirect binding.
So existing installations
integrated with SAML SSO should
work in the same way they did
before. Those customers wanting
to use POST binding can change
the configuration
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alation.authentication</span>
<span class="pre">.saml.force_redirect_binding</span></code>
to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code>.</p></td>

itself when the number of
published data sources extracted
by Alation did not match the
number of all published data
sources on the Tableau server
(which was greater). Because of a
bug, Alation did not paginate
through all available data
sources. After this fix, if a
workbook uses a published data

<h2>Release 5.6.10 - Security Patch<a class="headerlink" href="#release-5-6-10-security-patch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This patch is a critical fix that addresses the security vulnerability
with logging which has been described in the recent Security bulletin:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="summary">
<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist with debugging, the Alation application writes
exceptions to log files. Alation’s codebase includes an open-source
third-party exception-logging library called Raven. We recently
discovered that Raven has an undocumented bug such that it sometimes
logs usernames and passwords stored in the application memory to the
Alation log files in cleartext.</p>
<p>In this patch we completely deactivate Raven.Originally,we included
the Raven capabilities into Alation to have the richest possible logs
for rapid issue resolution. Although without Raven certain issues may be
more difficult to diagnose, we will continue to have other logging
information. There are no plans on adding those exception-logging
capabilities back, presently; we will rely on other kinds of logs and
monitoring for diagnosis of issues.</p>
<p>It is of paramount importance that this security patch is installed by
all customers.</p>
<p>Note that this patch does NOT remove any of the existing logs
from your Alation instance. If you have not purged the existing logs as
part of the security bulletin recommendations, please consider doing so
after you install the patch. For instructions, see Section IV-B of
the security bulletin April 17, 2019 - Important Security Alert: PII on Customer Servers.</p>
<p> Release 5.6.11 - Security Patch</p>
<p>We have discovered that in certain scenarios, service account
credentials may have been logged in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">taskserver.log</span></code> files. The details
have been described in our June 4, 2019 - Patch Alert/Security Bulletin: Data Source Credentials in taskserver.log Files. The patch fixes this logging problem.</p>
<p>Once you upgrade, please follow the instructions outlined in the
bulletin to delete any existing Taskserver logs from your Alation
instance.</p>
